# Changelog

> `main` moves ahead of the last published npm/GitHub release; a dependent repo should pin a tagged version, not `main`. See README § Development, "Releasing".

## Unreleased

- docs(SKILL.md): MCP line said "the other 42" stay callable (it is the other 30, as `mcp/server.py` and the tests say); `--fit-size off` described by what it does rather than "1.16 behaviour" (also in `caption.py --help`); workflow heading drops "always" (steps 0 and 8 are conditional). From a prompt audit.

## 2.3.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 2.3.0._

- fix(render): a plan's `check` verify step honours `"content": true` (`check.py --content`), with or without a `platform`, the same key a project's `check` stage takes. Before, `render.py PLAN` ran a check step only when it named a platform and never passed `--content`.
- fix(render): plan check step honours "content": true (#295)

## 2.3.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 2.2.5._

- feat(join): `--on-silent warn|fail|skip` (default `warn`) and `--silence-threshold DB` (default -50 dBFS). The preflight measures every input with audio (one volumedetect pass on a real run; `--dry-run` measures nothing and says so) and treats a peak at or below the threshold as silent -- the trace of a TTS step that wrote a valid but empty wav, which the 2.2.0 missing/empty/unreadable checks let through. `warn` joins it and names it under the new `silent: [{index, path, peak_db}]` key and in `notes`; `fail` refuses it in the same `kind: input` document as the other problems (`silent (peak -91.0 dBFS)`); `skip` drops it into `skipped`. Inputs without an audio stream are never silent. The join's own ffmpeg command is unchanged, and render.py forwards nothing new.
- fix: `audio.py` no longer passes a silent `--music` / `--replace` / `--effects` file, or a silent
  voice under `--duck`, as verified. Each is peak-measured in the 2.2.4 preflight (real runs; a dry run measures nothing);
  new `--on-silent warn|fail` (default warn: `silent: [{flag, path, peak_db}]` + note; fail:
  reason `silent (peak X dBFS)` in the one refusal) and `--silence-threshold` (default -50 dBFS).
- fix: no `--json` document contains `-Infinity` / `NaN` any more. `print_json` writes
  non-finite floats as `"-inf"` / `"inf"` / `null` (as `loudness.py` already did) with
  `allow_nan=False`; `export.py` on silent audio reports `loudness.lufs: "-inf"`,
  `silent: true`, and a note saying "output audio is silent" instead of recommending loudness.py.
- fix(caption): a burn whose cues are never visible is refused with `kind: input` instead of reporting `verified: true` -- every cue outside `[0, duration]`, every cue blank, or `--ass` with no `Dialogue` lines; applies to `waveform.py --srt` too. The `caption` block reports `cues_burned` and `cues_outside`, and cues partly outside get a warning note
- fix(graphics, overlay): whitespace-only `--title`, `--name`, `--text` (and the other text flags) count as missing and are refused instead of burning an empty graphic
- feat(check): `--content` (opt-in) adds `black` (blackdetect share: WARN > 10%, FAIL >= 95%), `frozen` (freezedetect longest span: WARN > max(3 s, 30%), FAIL when the whole video is frozen) and `silence` (silencedetect share at -50 dB: WARN > 50%, FAIL >= 95%) rows from one decode pass. Without it the row set is unchanged. render.py's `check` section takes `"content": true` to forward it.
- fix(check): the `audio` row no longer PASSes "present" for a silent track: FAIL under a platform/`--lufs` loudness target, WARN with none (a muted screen recording is legitimate), when the track is silent (peak <= -50 dBFS) -- read off the loudness pass, or from one volumedetect pass when `--no-loudness` or a spec without a loudness target skips it.
- fix(caption): the "re-run without --dry-run to produce X_adjusted.srt" note appears only on dry runs
- fix(join): a segment shorter than 2 frames (audio-only: 0.05 s) and a path listed twice no longer join unremarked: new `short_segments: [{index, path, duration}]` and `duplicates: [{path, indices}]` keys (always present, `[]` when none) plus notes. Warnings only; the join command is unchanged.
- fix(waveform): silent input audio no longer renders a flat-line audiogram without a word. A real run peak-measures the input; `--on-silent warn|fail` (default warn) and `--silence-threshold` (default -50 dBFS) as in `audio.py`; new `silent` key (`null` under `--dry-run`) and a note.
- fix(asr): a speech engine that ran and found no speech says `<engine> found no speech in <input>` (`kind: input`, `reason: "no_speech"`, `engine`) instead of faster-whisper's "no local speech-to-text engine found" or whisper.cpp / openai-whisper's "no cues found in /tmp/ffskill_asr_*/audio.srt".
- feat: catch valid-but-empty content (silent TTS, invisible captions, -Infinity JSON) (#294)

## 2.2.5

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 2.2.4._

- SKILL.md and README: `multicam.py --edl` is a plain cut list, not an EDL an editor opens. The multicam
  row now routes "for Premiere/Resolve" through `--write-project p.json` then `render.py --export-timeline`, and
  the "open it in Premiere / Resolve / Final Cut" row says to write a project first when there is none (found
  reading the eval-25 tl2 prompt).
- fix: route "timeline for Premiere" from multicam through --write-project; add eval 25 kit (#293)

## 2.2.4

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 2.2.3._

- **caption.py: an existing `.srt`/`.ass` side file is refused without `--overwrite`**, like the
  video. Through 2.2.3 only ffmpeg's output was checked: `--transcribe` warned and then replaced
  a hand-corrected transcript, and `--text`, `--write-srt` alone, the generated/`--write-ass`
  ASS, `_adjusted.srt` and `_offset.ass` were overwritten without a word -- even by a run that
  was then refused for the existing video. Every file the run will write is now checked up
  front (kind `input`, each existing one named), before speech recognition starts and before
  the first write; the dry run predicts the same refusal. New `_common.refuse_existing_outputs()`.
- **waveform.py: `--title` and `--srt`/`--text` stages get the shared flags.** graphics.py and
  caption.py are now launched with `--overwrite`, `--timeout`, `--fast` and `--dry-run`
  forwarded (as render.py's stages are), so a second run with `--overwrite` no longer fails in
  the caption or title stage. A failed stage keeps the child's own kind and hint instead of
  always `kind: ffmpeg`; the `_vis`/`_titled` intermediates are removed on failure too; a
  missing `--srt`/`--text` file is `kind: input` before anything is encoded; and
  `--title --dry-run` completes.
- **audio.py:** `--music`, `--effects` and `--replace` files that are missing, empty, unreadable
  or have no audio stream are refused together in one `kind: input` failure with
  `problems: [{flag, path, reason}]`, before ffmpeg runs (dry run included).
- **render.py:** a real run names every unreadable clip source in its preflight refusal, not
  only the first one.
- **sync.py / multicam.py:** "not enough audio to analyse" now names the file.
- fix: caption never overwrites sidecars silently; waveform, audio, sync and render name every bad input (#292)

## 2.2.3

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 2.2.2._

- `color.py --to-sdr` no longer tone-maps BT.2020 SDR input. A file with BT.2020 primaries on
  an SDR transfer (bt709, bt2020-10) went through the PQ tone map, which took white from Y 235
  to 151 and mid-grey from 126 to 90 and still reported `verified: true` -- and export, check,
  verify and the gotchas all send wide-gamut SDR files there. It now gets a gamut conversion
  only (its own transfer to linear, BT.2020 to BT.709 primaries, back to the BT.709 transfer);
  PQ, HLG, Dolby Vision and `--force` on an untagged file are tone-mapped as before. The result
  says which path ran in the new `sdr_path` key (`tonemap` / `gamut`) and in `notes`.
- **join.py: a crossfaded join keeps each clip's sound with its picture.** Every clip now has one
  length for both streams -- its video stream's, or its audio's when the sound runs more than a
  frame past the picture -- and the shorter stream is padded to it (silence, or the last frame
  held) before `xfade`/`acrossfade`, whose offsets both come from it. Clips with 5 s of picture
  and 3 s of narration used to speak clip 2 at ~2.6 s instead of 4.5 s; audio longer than the
  picture could lose a clip's picture; parts gained a frame or two per join from the container's
  AAC tail. `verified` now includes a `duration` step comparing the output's video-stream length
  with `expected_duration`, and `probe` reports each stream's own `duration`. The audio-only
  join and `--transition none` build the same commands as before.
- fix: color --to-sdr keeps BT.2020 SDR bright; crossfaded joins keep sound with picture (#291)

## 2.2.2

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 2.2.1._

- `join.py --dry-run` no longer fails a plan because one of its inputs is not written yet. The
  pending file's placeholder probe always claimed a video stream, so a TTS list with one line
  still to come was refused as an audio/video mix ("tts_01.wav has no video stream while
  tts_03.wav has one"), a list of nothing but pending `.wav` lines planned a libx264 join into
  `voice.wav`, and a `render.py --dry-run` of an audio project with one trimmed and one untrimmed
  clip failed at the join. A pending input's extension now stands in for its streams: any
  audio extension the skill reads (`.wav`, `.m4a`, `.aiff`, `.caf`, ...) means no picture. A
  join's audio rate and layout come from the inputs that exist, and each pending input is
  named -- a stderr note, the new `pending` key and `notes` -- instead of being passed over in
  silence. A pending `.mp4` next to a measured `.wav` is still refused as the mix a real run
  refuses, now naming the `.wav` and the file expected to hold a picture. With either
  `--on-missing` a dry run plans on a pending input and never lists it under `skipped`; a real
  run still refuses or skips a file that is missing when it runs, and under `skip` the note
  says when skipping would leave fewer than two inputs, which a real run refuses.
  `expected_duration` is `null` while an input is pending: the placeholder's 0 s made it negative,
  or shorter than the one clip that exists. In a video join, `notes` also says when the planned
  frame and rate (a pending first input) or xfade offsets (after a pending input) are the
  placeholder's unmeasured values. Real runs are unchanged.
- `render.py --export-timeline` writes FCPXML that validates against Apple's FCPXML 1.10 DTD:
  the music bed now comes before the chapter markers inside the first clip (the DTD's order is
  `timeMap`, connected clips, markers). 2.1.0-2.2.1 wrote them the other way round, which does
  not validate -- and Final Cut validates what it imports against that DTD.
- `--export-timeline` reads clip `in`/`out` and chapter times the way the render does (`"0:05"`,
  `hh:mm:ss:ff` at the source's fps, `@fps`). Before, any string time was a Python traceback
  with nothing on stdout under `--json` -- including the `"in": "0:00"` of `render.py --init`'s
  own starter project. A time that does not parse is now a `kind: input` failure naming the
  field (`clips[0].in`). A clip with no picture has no fps of its own, and `frame.fps` does not
  stand in for one in either path: its `hh:mm:ss:ff` needs `@fps`, as `cut.py` asks.
- `render.py` refuses, as `kind: input` naming the key, a value that is not an object where
  the run reads it. 2.2.1 died there with a traceback and nothing on stdout under `--json`. In
  the render and `--export-timeline` alike, that covers a string `frame`, a clip written as a
  bare path, a clip with no `src`, a string `audio` and a string `transition` between two or
  more clips. In the render it also covers every stage section (`"export": "reels"`,
  `"captions": "subs.srt"`) and the `snap` of a clip it cuts, up to the `--stop-after`
  stage (a `--stop-after fit` preview never reads `captions`). Nothing a full run never reads is
  refused. A single clip's `"transition": "none"` and an uncut clip's `snap` still render and
  export. `--export-timeline` still writes a timeline for a stage section that is not an
  object and lists it in `not_exported`, as 2.2.1 did.
- The exported sequence is the frame the project asks for, sized by fit.py's own rule:
  `frame: {aspect: "16:9", width: 1920}` is 1920x1080 over any source (it was 1920x2160 over a
  4K one, the height taken from the source). An aspect-only frame takes the export preset's
  size when the preset has that aspect, as the render's does. fit.py now sizes its output with
  the same shared function (`frame_size()`) and reads `--aspect` with the same parser
  (`aspect_ratio()`), which reads each side with `int()` as fit.py did, so fit.py accepts and
  sizes every `--aspect` exactly as 2.2.1 did. The export now refuses a `frame.aspect` of `16/9`
  or `2.39:1` when the render would hand it to fit.py, which refuses it too. The render's own preset match
  (`frame_from_preset()`) keeps 2.2.1's looser reading, so a `16/9` frame replaced by the
  project's `fit.aspect` renders exactly as before, and the export writes its frame.
- A render of several clips delivers that frame too. When the frame gives an aspect and one
  side, and the project's `fit` object gives no width, height or other aspect, `render.py`
  now gives fit.py that side. Before, join.py sized the join at the first clip's aspect and
  fit.py fitted the new aspect inside it: `{aspect: "9:16", width: 1080}` (`render.py`'s own
  docstring frame) over 16:9 clips came out 342x608 -- the delivered size without an export
  preset, and the size captions were burned at with one. Every other multi-clip project renders
  at the size 2.2.1 rendered.
- FCPXML describes each video asset as its own source (size and frame rate) and the sequence
  as the frame; one shared format made a 320x180 file under a 9:16 frame claim to be
  1080x1920. A clip of another aspect states its spatial conform, `adjust-conform` `fill` for
  `frame.fit: crop` and `fit` for pad; the DTD reads a missing one as fit, so a crop project
  was exported as a fit. EDL and OTIO cannot state a conform, so there the reframe is listed in
  `not_exported` with the project's `frame.fit`, as is `blur`'s blurred background in all three.

- Known, carried into a minor release (`docs/design-decisions.md` records each one):
  - A multi-clip render with `frame.fit: crop` keeps bars on every clip of another aspect than
    the joined frame, even when all the clips share one aspect: join.py pads the clips into
    the frame before fit.py crops. The exported timeline states `fill`, the project's choice.
  - A project `fit` object with its own width, height or aspect is still fitted inside a
    multi-clip join's picture, as in 2.2.1 (`fit {aspect 4:5}` under `{aspect 9:16, width 72}`
    renders 32x40 against a 72x128 sequence). Which of `frame` and `fit` wins waits for that
    release.
  - For a value that is not an object in a section a path never reads, the export and the
    render can still disagree, as in 2.2.1. Refusing it in both paths would refuse projects
    2.2.1 rendered or exported.
  - `batch.py` names every intermediate of a `.ogg`, `.opus`, `.aac`, `.aif`/`.aiff`, `.caf`
    or `.wma` source `.mp4`, so a `--dry-run` of a join step over those sources is refused as
    an audio/video mix that the real batch completes (as in 2.2.1).
- fix: join dry-run plans pending inputs; --export-timeline times, frame and FCPXML order (#290)
- ci: the auto-bump moves the roadmap's released-version sentence (#289)
- docs: roadmap names 2.2.1 as the released version (#288)

## 2.2.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 2.2.0._

- The same check-everything-first rule as `join.py --list`, where one bad input used to cost a
  whole run: `render.py` checks every clip source before cutting the first one and names every
  missing, empty or directory source in one refusal (`problems[]`) -- before, a missing clip 7
  surfaced after clips 0-6 were cut, one missing source per rerun. `caption.py --mode mux`
  names every missing extra `--srt` track at once, before any work. `sequence.py` warns when
  frames exist past a gap in the numbering instead of silently stopping at the gap.
- fix: render/caption/sequence name every bad input before any work (#287)

## 2.2.0

### Added

- `join.py --list parts.txt` joins the segments a TTS or render step wrote, one path per line
  (relative to the list; `#` comments and ffmpeg's `file 'x.wav'` lines accepted). Every input
  is now checked before anything runs, and a missing, empty or unreadable one is named together
  with every other problem in a single refusal (`kind: input`, `problems[]`) instead of being
  found one rerun at a time; `--on-missing skip` joins the rest and lists what it left out under
  the new `skipped` key. An empty list is refused as such. Asked for by a user whose VPS short-video
  pipeline crashed when one TTS line failed and emptied its concat list.

## 2.1.0

### Added

- `render.py project.json --export-timeline edit.fcpxml|edit.edl|edit.otio` writes the project's
  cut as an editor timeline instead of rendering it -- FCPXML 1.10 (Final Cut Pro, DaVinci
  Resolve), CMX 3600 EDL (Premiere, Resolve, Avid) or OpenTimelineIO JSON. Clips keep their
  in/out and speed, `transition` becomes a cross dissolve centred on each cut (trimmed so the
  timeline is exactly `join.py`'s rendered length), `audio.music` is its own track and inline
  `chapters` are markers. Nothing is encoded. Everything else the project asks for (captions,
  graphics, overlays, the silence cut, fit, audio processing, loudness, export) is listed in the
  new `timeline` result block's `not_exported` and on stderr, never dropped silently; a file that
  exists is refused without `--overwrite`, like every output. Verified: the three formats read
  back at the right length through the reference `opentimelineio` library and its FCPXML and
  CMX 3600 adapters. Not verified here: Final Cut, Resolve or Premiere opening them (#143).

### Fixed

- `export.py`'s colour warning called a BT.2020 SDR source "HDR (BT.2020 SDR)" -- 1.x wording
  that 2.0's `hdr` contradicts. It now says "wide-gamut SDR, not HDR" for that case, and still
  points at `color.py --to-sdr` (found by eval 24 h1).
- `docs/demos.md` still printed `proxy.py --crf 34`, a flag 2.0 removed; the gallery is
  regenerated.

## 2.0.0

What 1.10.0 announced for 2.0 (`contract --json`'s `deprecated` list): four changes made, one
withdrawn (`result_v2`, below). No new feature; tool count still 42. `docs/contract.md` "What 2.0 changed" is the migration table, and
`contract --json` now lists the same under `removed`, with the version that deprecated each.

### Removed

- `--crf` on every re-encoding tool that has `--quality` (deprecated in 1.10.0): it was an alias
  of `--quality`, and argparse now refuses it. `--quality`'s default is what `--crf`'s was (18;
  `proxy.py` 30). `export.py` keeps its own `--crf` -- its preset chooses the encoder, so it is not
  an alias. A `render.py` project's `export.crf` still reaches `export.py --crf`.
- `json` and `progress` from every MCP `inputSchema` (deprecated in 1.10.0): they are transport
  flags the server sets itself, as `FFMPEG_SKILL_MCP_LEAN=1` showed since 1.10.0; that variable
  no longer does anything. A client that still sends them is not refused. The frozen MCP snapshot
  is regenerated.
- The `result_v2` preview key and `FFMPEG_SKILL_RESULT_V2` (1.10.0 deprecated the flat keys in its
  favour). It was withdrawn rather than promoted: it put a key in `metrics` or `details` by its
  value (a number in one, the same key holding `null` in the other), so a caller could not know
  where to look without the value. The flat top-level keys, typed per tool in `output_schema`, are
  the 2.0 shape -- unchanged from 1.x.

### Changed

- An existing output is refused without `--overwrite` (1.x warned; deprecated in 1.10.0):
  `kind: input`, before any ffmpeg runs, dry runs included, with a hint naming the flag.
  `FFMPEG_SKILL_NO_OVERWRITE` no longer does anything.
- `probe`'s `hdr` is true only for a PQ / HLG transfer or Dolby Vision (deprecated in 1.10.0),
  equal to `hdr_signal`, which stays. The new `bt2020_or_hdr` carries the 1.x meaning (BT.2020
  primaries count), and every editing tool routes on it, so a BT.2020 SDR source still re-encodes
  as HEVC Main10 with its own tags: tool behaviour is unchanged. `hdr_format` still names
  `BT.2020 SDR`.
- `docs/contract.md`: "Stability guarantee (2.x)"; the deprecation policy records that 2.0.0
  waived the 90-day half of its window (the deprecations date from 1.10.0, 2026-09-13; sixteen
  minor releases carried them), and `tests/test_contract.py` requires such a waiver to be stated
  there. `ctx` on `run()`/`emit()`/`die()` stays optional (docs/design-decisions.md says why).
- `render.py` refuses an existing project output before its first stage runs, not at the final
  copy after every stage had.
- `demos/build.py` clears a demo's own outputs before rebuilding it, since a tool now refuses to
  replace them.

### Also in this release

- Fix: `docs/contract.md`'s historical versions no longer move with every release. The auto-bump in `release.yml` replaced every occurrence of the outgoing version in that file, so each "Since" in "What 2.0 changes" (all 1.10.0), "Per-tool keys added in 1.17.1 / 1.18.0", `broken_inside_word` (1.18.4), "every version before 1.18.3", `examples[]` (1.21.0) and `supports_json_brief` (1.11.0) had been rewritten to 1.26.0. They are restored from git history, and the bump now lives in `.github/scripts/bump_contract_md.py`, which moves only the `skill.version` row and the example's `version`, each required exactly once.
- Tests: the 2.0 table's Since column is pinned to `_contract.DEPRECATED`, and a package.json major bump fails before the policy's window has passed (two further minors and 90 days after 1.10.0: 2026-12-12) or while a deprecated entry is still listed.

- fix: 1.17.2 — caption ASS side margins from the horizontal safe zone (#239)
- docs: eval 19 at 1.17.1 (26 runs, the margin root cause, 1.17.2 queued) (#238)

### Fixed

- **Caption side margins are the horizontal safe zone, not the vertical one** (eval 19 headline,
  present since 1.14). `caption.py`'s generated ASS (`--animate`, `--karaoke`, the emoji overlay
  route) wrote `--margin` into the Style's `MarginL` and `MarginR` as well as `MarginV`. But
  `--margin` is the *vertical* safe margin: `--platform tiktok` makes it 22 % of the frame height
  = 63 ASS units = **420 px** on a 1080x1920 frame, so libass was given a 1080 - 840 = **240 px**
  text column and broke "Hello world" into "Hello" over "world", one word per line — while the
  fitter and the wrapper measured against the horizontal safe width, reported `split: 0` and put
  no `\N` in the file. `MarginL`/`MarginR` now come from the destination's own `safe.left` /
  `safe.right` (TikTok: 54 px and 151 px on a 1080-wide frame, the like/share rail included), or
  from the conventional `(1 - SAFE_WIDTH_FRACTION)/2` border with no `--platform`, and the
  fitter's budget is exactly `play_w - MarginL - MarginR`, so the wrap the ASS states is the wrap
  libass draws. The SRT `force_style` burn path never set side margins and is unchanged.
  **Behaviour change, allowed by the stability paragraph of `docs/contract.md` because it fixes a
  defect**: the pinned `--fit-size off` fixture (`tests/fixtures/caption_1_16_1_fitsize_off.ass`)
  carried the wrong margins and has been re-pinned; `--fit-size off` still means "the size is
  never shrunk".

## 1.17.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.17.0._

### Fixed

- **The caption size is fitted on the template path too.** `render.py --template NAME` fills the
  caption `size` from the delivery table and forwarded it as an explicit `--size`, which is how
  `caption.py` is told "a human chose this size" — so `--fit-size auto` never ran and a long cue
  was split across two consecutive cues on every template run (eval 18 cw1/dl1/dl3/dl4), the one
  path a "make this a TikTok" request takes. A template's filled project now states
  `"fit_size": "on"`; a template file that states its own `fit_size`, and a brand file that
  actually states `caption.size`, still win — `--brand` on its own is not a stated size, so a
  brand of colours or a font keeps the fit — and `"fit_size": "off"` reproduces 1.17.0's captions
  byte for byte.
- **`render.py` project captions accept `fit_size`, `min_size` and `fit_size_scope`** (eval 18
  cs1: the keys were refused as unknown, so the fit policy could not be stated in a project at
  all and the four stages had to be run by hand). `render.py`'s result also carries the caption
  stage's own block as `caption`.
- **SKILL.md routes the 1.17 features.** Filler words → `silence.py --filler --words`, cutting to
  the music → `scenes.py --beats` then `cut.py --snap beats`, a folder and the cores →
  `batch.py --jobs auto`, one stage changed → `render.py --cache DIR`. None of them appeared in
  the routing table, so runs rebuilt them by hand or reported the feature does not exist (eval 18
  bt2/fw1/fw3/rc1). Paid for with duplicated wording elsewhere: the file is still under the
  30,000-byte budget.
- **One label for a partial result.** SKILL.md now states it: a partial result is `Done:` with the
  shortfall in `Notes:`, never a third label like `Done (partially):`.
- **`caption.py` says when the text is unchanged**: `caption text unchanged` in the summary and
  `text_unchanged: true` in the result when the drawn text equals the cues that were handed in —
  nothing transcribed, no cue dropped, no cue split across two cues and no glyph stripped by
  `--emoji none`. Wrapping, line breaks and timing do not count as a change; the key is burn mode
  only (`--mode mux` never touches the text and omits it).
- **#234: child-process output is decoded as UTF-8, never as the machine's code page.** On a
  Windows cp932 locale `text=True` decoded ffprobe's UTF-8 JSON with the console code page, the
  reader thread raised `UnicodeDecodeError`, `communicate()` returned an empty stdout and
  `probe.py` printed `?s | no video | no audio` and exited 0 — an unmeasured file reported as
  measured. Every child capture in `scripts/` (ffmpeg, ffprobe, fc-list/fc-match, whisper, the
  sibling tools render.py and batch.py run) now passes `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` --
  including `run_analysis()`, the capture every ffmpeg *measurement* goes through, and the two
  captures in `evals/` -- and
  a probe whose ffprobe printed nothing refuses with `kind: input` naming the unreadable output
  instead of returning a document of nulls.
- **evals**: `write_fixtures.py` stages a batch recipe's `output_dir` absolute under the prompt's
  own directory — a relative `"out"` resolved against the caller's cwd, so the staged recipe wrote
  outside the prompt folder and had to be rewritten before the prompt could be answered.
- fix: 1.17.1 — fit-size reachable from templates, SKILL.md routes the 1.17 features, UTF-8 child output (#234) (#237)
- docs: eval 18 at 1.17.0 (100 prompts, focused Opus grader, trigger 50/50) (#236)

## 1.17.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.16.1._

_1.17.0 — throughput, plus the caption-size half of the eval-17 finding. The release
workflow turns this heading into the version number._

### Added

- **`caption.py --fit-size auto|on|off`, `--min-size N`, `--fit-size-scope file|cue`.** The caption
  size is fitted to the cue *before* the cue is split. At a platform caption size (24 ASS units,
  about six em per line at 1080x1920) an ordinary sentence needs four lines, so `--max-lines 2`
  cut it into consecutive cues and half of it arrived late — the size, not the breaker, was what
  did not fit. `--min-size` defaults to `ass_units(0.045) = 13`, the 4.5 %-of-frame-height
  legibility floor, one floor for every destination. New keys inside the existing `caption` block:
  `fit_size`, `size_requested`, `size_used`, `size_floor`, `size_pct_height`, `shrunk`,
  `fit_scope`, `fit_exhausted`. The caption text is never rewritten, shortened or paraphrased to
  make it fit; below the floor the cue is split exactly as before and `fit_exhausted` says so.
- **`scenes.py --beats`, `--beat-step`, `--beat-range`, `--min-confidence`.** The measured beat
  grid — onset flux, median+MAD peak picking, an autocorrelation tempo with octave
  disambiguation, and a confidence that is half how far the winning lag stands above the others
  and half the fraction of onsets that land on the grid. New keys `beats` and `beat_grid`. With
  `--beats` the file is decoded once and both envelopes come from that pass.
- **`cut.py --snap beats`, `--snap-tolerance`, `--snap-source`, `--min-confidence`.** In/out points
  move to the nearest measured beat before the keyframe decision. Below the confidence threshold
  the run refuses and names the measured number and `--snap none`: a cut point may move to a
  measured grid point and may not appear from one. New key `snap`. `render.py` forwards a
  project's `"snap": {"to": "beats", ...}` and reports what came back.
- **`silence.py --filler`** and its family (`--filler-lang`, `--filler-words`, `--filler-extra`,
  `--filler-keep`, `--filler-pad`, `--words`, `--transcribe`, `--filler-list`, `--max-cuts`).
  Filler words are removed through the existing `keep_ranges()`/`aselect` graph — and only where a
  speech engine measured a start/end pair for the word. Built-in lists for en, ja, es, de, fr, pt
  and it; `like`, `tipo` and `cioè` are deliberately not in them (discourse markers are not
  disfluencies) and are reachable with `--filler-extra`. New keys `filler` and
  `removed_seconds_total` (silence plus filler); `removed_seconds` is unchanged and still holds
  the silence-only figure. Whisper stays optional for this tool
  exactly as it is for `caption.py`. `--transcribe` drives whichever engine is installed with
  its own word-timestamp option (whisper.cpp `--output-json-full`, faster-whisper
  `word_timestamps=True`, openai-whisper `--word_timestamps True`); an engine whose build
  produces none refuses by name rather than reporting an empty removal as a success.
- **`batch.py --jobs N|auto`.** Parallel items under one shared `--timeout` budget, capped at
  `min(N, cpu_count, 8)` with the applied value reported. The per-item table keeps its shape and
  its order, and each item's log is flushed in file order. New keys `jobs`, `jobs_requested`,
  `wall_seconds`, `item_seconds_total`, `timed_out`.
- **`render.py --cache DIR` and `--from STAGE`.** An opt-in stage cache keyed on the stage, its
  arguments, its inputs' content hashes, the flags render forwards to its children (`--fast`,
  `--codec`, …), the output's extension and the ffmpeg build banner plus the skill and contract
  versions, so a cache is never reused across any of them. New key `cache`. There is no default cache directory.

### Changed

- `caption.py` now fits the caption size to the cue before splitting it when the size was not
  stated (`--fit-size auto`, the default). A run that passed `--size` explicitly, or that took a
  size from a `brand.json`, is unchanged; `--fit-size off` restores 1.16.1 byte-for-byte (a pinned
  ASS fixture asserts it). This changes the rendered ASS for platform caption runs that took the
  default size — the defect eval 17 measured.
- The optional local speech-to-text bridge and the SRT reader/writer moved from `caption.py` into
  `scripts/_common/asr.py` and are re-exported through the `_common` facade, so `silence.py
  --filler --transcribe` shares one engine probe and one "no engine found" message.
  `caption.parse_srt`, `caption.transcribe` and `caption.whisper_word_timings` are unchanged as
  names; `caption.py --help` is byte-identical.

### Fixed

- `render.py` left its auto-named work directory behind after a failed render: a function-local
  `import shutil` shadowed the module-level one and the `atexit` cleanup raised `NameError`.
  (Introduced by this release's own `--cache` work; 1.16.1 never had it.)
- feat: 1.17.0 — throughput (caption size that fits the cue, beat-synced cuts, filler-word removal, batch --jobs, render --cache) (#235)

## 1.16.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.16.0._

### Fixed

- **Caption breaking, from eval 17.** A Thai run is no longer broken inside: Thai writes no space
  inside a phrase and the wrapper has no dictionary, so every character-level break it took landed
  inside a word (`ข|อง`, `เว|ลา`); the break now goes where the writer put a space or a `|`, and a
  run with none stays long on its own line, the rule long Latin words already follow. A katakana
  word is one atom (`タイ|ミング` was split like a run of kanji). `caption.py` reports an `overlong`
  count in its caption stats and an info line naming the fix (a space or `|` where the line may
  break, or a smaller `--size`) when a wrapped line is wider than the safe width. `--wrap measured`
  follows the same atom rules (it is the post-passes that differ, not the pieces).
- fix: captions never break inside a Thai run or a katakana word; over-wide lines are reported (eval 17) (#233)
- docs: eval 17 at 1.16.0 (90 prompts, focused Opus grader, trigger 45/45) (#232)

## 1.16.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.15.1._

### Added

- **Audiogram: `waveform.py --image` and `render.py --template audiogram`.** The visualisation
  over a still plate, which is what turns a podcast episode into something postable.
  `--image PATH` (a local file), `--image-fit cover|contain|blur`, `--position
  bottom|centre|top|strip`, `--vis-height FRAC`, `--opacity`, `--platform NAME` (the frame from
  the delivery table; a destination with no frame is refused), `--title TEXT` (drawn through
  `graphics.py`) and `--srt`/`--text` (burnt by `caption.py` afterwards, so neither code path is
  re-implemented). Result key `audiogram`. Nothing is fetched and no cover art is ever invented:
  give an image or a colour. **No new tool — the tool count stays 42**; `docs/design-decisions.md`
  records why an `audiogram.py` would have been a second spelling of `waveform.py` and, under the
  1.x guarantee, permanent surface.
- **`metadata.py --auto-chapters`: chapter markers proposed from measured structure.** Pauses
  (silencedetect) and scene changes (scdet) become candidates; a scene cut within 1 s of a
  silence end merges into one `silence+scene` marker. `--min-chapter` (default 60),
  `--max-chapters`, `--from silence|scenes|both`, `--silence-threshold`/`--silence-min`,
  `--scene-threshold`, `--chapters-out FILE` (this tool's own `--chapters` format, so the titles
  can be edited and fed back) and `--description-out FILE` (the YouTube `00:00 Chapter 1` block).
  Result key `auto_chapters`, with each marker's evidence. **Every title is `Chapter N` and the
  result says `"titles": "placeholder"`** — the skill proposes where a chapter starts, it cannot
  know what is in one; naming them is the caller's job. Output is still `-c copy`; two detectors
  mean two decodes, which `--help` and `notes` both say.
- **Several language-tagged subtitle tracks in one `caption.py --mode mux`.** `--srt` is
  repeatable and each file may carry a `:lang` suffix (`--srt en.srt:en --srt ja.srt:ja`). The
  suffix splits on the last colon and only when the tail is a BCP-47-shaped code and the whole
  token is not itself a file, so `C:\subs\en.srt` and a file named `a:b.srt` survive.
  `--track-title` (a frozen display-name table by default — data, never a translation) and
  `--default-track LANG`. Result keys `tracks` and `subtitle_tracks`. Empirically (ffmpeg 6.1),
  `.mp4`/`.mov` hold several `mov_text` tracks but drop a two-letter language code without a
  word, so the code is converted to ISO-639-2 (`en` → `eng`); Matroska stores what it is given,
  and past two tracks in an MPEG-4 container the result recommends `.mkv` in `notes`. The skill
  never translates and never generates a second language.
- **`check.py`: an informational `subtitles` row on every platform.** `PASS` when every soft
  subtitle stream carries a language tag, `WARN` when one does not or when there are none. Like
  the podcast `channels`/`chapters` rows it is never counted in `failed`.

### Fixed

- **The audiogram ignored `--fps` / `--platform`.** A looped still is fed to ffmpeg at 25 fps
  unless told otherwise, and `overlay` takes its rate from the first input, so
  `--platform tiktok` announced 30 fps and wrote a 25 fps file (the colour-plate path was never
  affected: `color=` carries its own `r=`). The still now gets `-framerate`, and the frame rate
  joined the frame size and duration in what `audiogram.verified` actually checks.
- **`--mode mux` marked a track `default` that nobody asked for.** With two or more new subtitle
  streams and no `--default-track`, ffmpeg flags the first one itself — the opposite of what the
  flag promises, and `tracks[].default` then described a file that did not exist. Every
  disposition is stated explicitly now (`default` for the chosen track, `0` for the rest).
  MPEG-4 cannot express "no default subtitle track" at all — it always enables its first one —
  so there the track is *reported* `default: true` with a note, because the result document
  describes the file, not the request.
- **`audiogram.verified` was `true` under `--dry-run`**, where nothing had been rendered to
  verify, while the common top-level `verified` said `false` for the same run.
- **`--image` that ffmpeg cannot decode** is refused with `kind: input` naming the file, before
  any encode starts, instead of surfacing as a raw ffmpeg failure.
- **A malformed `:lang` suffix** (`--srt en.srt:zzzz`) is reported as a bad language code naming
  the token, not as a missing file called `en.srt:zzzz`.
- **`から`, `まで` and `より` are matched as whole words.** They had been left in the
  *character* table of Japanese particles, which made `か`, `ら`, `ま`, `で`, `よ` and `り`
  one-character particles of their own — none of them is — so a break before `か` was forbidden
  and a break after it preferred.
- **MPEG-4 subtitle track titles are no longer claimed.** `-metadata:s:s:N title=` is dropped by
  the MPEG-4 muxer, so `tracks[].title` reported a name the file did not carry; it is `null`
  there now, with a note saying `.mkv` keeps the names.
- `metadata.py --auto-chapters`' "no chapters found" hint no longer suggests the value already
  in use (`--min-chapter 1` was answered with "try `--min-chapter 1`").
- `graphics.py --template sticker` wraps its label to the chip's own width rather than the
  frame's, so a long `--text` cannot overflow the plate it is drawn on.

### Changed

- **`caption.py` and `graphics.py` wrap phrase-aware by default (`--wrap measured` restores
  1.15.1).** Four rules, all penalties over break positions that already fit, so no line is
  widened and the line count never changes: never inside a word or on the wrong side of a hyphen;
  no line that is a lone digit, one or two punctuation characters or a single kana, checked at
  every boundary rather than only the last; Japanese/Chinese breaks preferred after `。、！？」』）`
  and after a particle — a particle is enclitic, so kinsoku keeps it with the word before it and a
  break *before* one is forbidden — discouraged between a kanji stem and its okurigana and
  forbidden before a small kana; and an article or preposition kept with the phrase it governs, by
  preferring the break before it and penalising the break after it. **The `rebalanced` count in
  the `cues:` line can differ for an unchanged input**, and a cue whose break moves is the point
  of the release — the text itself is never rewritten, shortened or translated. graphics.py's hook
  card, meme lines and sticker chip are now wrapped to the frame's safe width instead of running
  off the edge; a label that already fits is untouched.
  Eval 16's two open cues come out whole: `dl1` breaks as `A third line / the tool times for me`
  (1.15: `A third line the / tool times for me`) and `dl3` as `自動でタイミングが / 決まる行`
  (1.15: `自動でタイミングが決ま / る行`). `--wrap measured` reproduces the old splits.
- `layout_cues` wraps each cue once instead of three times. The greedy fill is identical for
  every mode, so `wrap_variants()` does it once and repeats only the post-passes, which is what
  `rebalanced` and `phrase_breaks` need to be counted against.
- The caption breaker moved from `caption.py` into `_common/text.py`, and the two structure
  detectors (`silence.detect`, `scenes.detect_scenes`) into `_common/probe.py`, so
  `metadata.py --auto-chapters` measures without any tool in `scripts/` importing a sibling tool.
  Both moves are byte-for-byte; `caption.wrap_text`, `silence.detect` and `scenes.detect_scenes`
  still resolve where they always did.
- feat: 1.16.0 — long-form delivery (audiogram, auto chapters, multi-language subtitle tracks, phrase-aware captions) (#231)

## 1.15.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.15.0._

### Changed

- **refactor: `scripts/_common.py` is a package, and `tests/test_all.py` splits by tool group.
  No behaviour change.** A release of its own so that "nothing changed for a caller" is checkable
  in one diff (roadmap, "Refactor release after 1.15.0"). The 3072-line helper module is now
  `scripts/_common/` with one module per responsibility — `runner.py` (process execution,
  timeouts, signals, the output lock and staging, `run_tool`, the drawtext text-file spool),
  `probe.py` (ffprobe and the measured facts: `probe()`, `verify_output()`, the level and
  envelope measurements), `decision.py` (the pure choices: encoder and codec arguments, times,
  paths, brand defaults — nothing here starts a subprocess), `emit.py` (`emit()`, `die()`,
  `info()`, the brief and 2.0 shapes, the plan file), `color.py` (bt709 tagging, the HDR-to-SDR
  path, colour-token validation) and `text.py` (fonts per script, emoji clusters and assets,
  drawtext escaping and options, the advance table the caption wrap measures with).
  `scripts/_common/__init__.py` is a facade re-exporting all **184** names the single file
  defined — public and underscore alike — so every `from _common import ...` and every
  `_common.<name>` in the tools, the MCP server, the demos, the evals and the tests keeps
  working unchanged; rebinding a name on the facade (`_common._FFMPEG_VERSION = (7, 1)`, a
  `mock.patch("_common.<name>")`) rebinds it on the module that defines it, so the test seams
  that reached into the module still hold. Function bodies were moved, not edited.
  `tests/test_all.py` is a `load_tests` aggregator over `tests/test_analysis.py`,
  `test_editing.py`, `test_audio.py`, `test_picture.py`, `test_delivery.py` and
  `test_orchestration.py` with the shared footage in `tests/_fixtures.py` (built once per
  process, not once per group); each group module also runs on its own. `npm test` and every CI
  job are unchanged and run the same 323 cases under the same names.
  Proof of no behaviour change: `scripts/_contract.py --json`, the MCP `tools/list` response and
  `--help` for all 42 tools are **byte-identical** to 1.15.0. The tool count stays 42 — a package
  directory is not a tool, and every `scripts/*.py` enumeration (the contract, the MCP server,
  `demos/build.py`, the every-script tests) skips it unchanged; the source *scans* that must not
  stop covering the helpers (`shell=True` and friends) now read `scripts/_common/*.py` too.

## 1.15.0

### Added

- **Emoji in captions and titles.** `caption.py`, `graphics.py` and `overlay.py` gain `--emoji auto|color|png|mono|none`, `--emoji-assets DIR`, `--emoji-scale FLOAT` and `--emoji-max N`. The colour route is a **PNG overlay**, not a font: drawtext cannot load a CBDT/sbix emoji face at all (it fails filter initialisation — `Could not set font size to 48 pixels: invalid library handle`, and at the font's own strike `Monocromatic (1bpp) fonts are not supported.` — and writes no file), and an installed colour emoji family proves nothing either (Noto Color Emoji installs cleanly on builds whose libass still draws a monochrome outline). `--emoji-assets DIR` is a directory of PNGs named by code point in the Twemoji/Noto convention (`1f389.png`, `1f1ef-1f1f5.png`, `1f469-200d-1f4bb.png`), also read from `brand.json` (`styles.caption.emoji_assets`) and `FFMPEG_SKILL_EMOJI_ASSETS`. **Nothing is ever downloaded**: a missing directory is `kind: input` naming the two sets people already have, never a fetch. In a caption the text keeps its place in the generated ASS with an invisible placeholder reserving exactly the emoji's box (measured: U+2588 FULL BLOCK is 0.66–0.83 em depending on the face, so the gap is reserved with alpha-hidden `\fsp` spacing instead, which is exact in every face this repo resolves — including inside a `\kf` karaoke run, where the placeholder is its own zero-duration segment), and each PNG is composited after the `ass=` filter. `caption.py`/`graphics.py --json` gain an `emoji` block (`mode`, `count`, `clusters`, `assets`, `missing`, `overlays`); `--json-brief` carries `mode` and `count`. Emoji also count as a full em in the wrap, so an emoji-heavy line no longer overflows the safe area, and a wrap never breaks inside a ZWJ sequence, a flag pair or a skin-tone modifier.
- **`doctor` answers what this machine can do with emoji**: `doctor --json` → `.fonts.emoji` (`mode`, `color_font`, `color_font_file`, `libass_color`, `assets`, `detail`, `fix`), where `libass_color` comes from a ~80 ms **render probe** (one 64×64 frame with an emoji cue through `subtitles=`, chroma-tested) rather than a font listing. `contract --json --static` and every other static/JSON-only path skip the probe and report `libass_color: null` (`doctor` itself always probes -- it has no `--static`). Informational like the rest of `fonts`: it never moves `ok` or a tool's `usable`. The plain-text `doctor` gains one clause on its existing `fonts:` line.
- **`graphics.py --text-render auto|ass|drawtext` and `--write-ass PATH`.** drawtext does bidi and Arabic joining correctly on a build with `--enable-libfribidi`, so Arabic and Hebrew were already right; what it cannot do on **any** build is reorder and re-cluster — Devanagari matras, Thai/Lao mark stacking — because it does not use harfbuzz even in an `--enable-libharfbuzz` build. `auto` (the default) therefore renders a shaping script (`hi bn ta te kn ml gu pa si th lo km my`) through libass, writing `<output>_gfx.ass` from the geometry the templates already computed (new private module `scripts/_ass_overlay.py` — the public tool count is unchanged at 42) and reporting `text_renderer`, `script` and `ass` in the JSON. Latin, CJK and Arabic frames are pixel-identical to 1.14.0 (the *command* is not: every drawn label now goes through `textfile=…:expansion=none` instead of `text=…`, which is what makes `'` and `%` survive). `--text-render drawtext` with such a script is a refusal naming the script, never a wrongly shaped frame.
- **`bn` (Bengali), `ta` (Tamil) and `lo` (Lao)** join the scripts the tools detect and resolve fonts for: `doctor --json` `.fonts.scripts` has three more entries.

### Fixed

- **`'` and `%` survive the drawn text** (eval 14). `overlay.py --text "it's 100% done"` rendered `its 100 done`: `escape_drawtext()` dropped both characters because neither has a backslash escape that is safe in every call shape. Drawn text now reaches drawtext as `textfile=<path>:expansion=none`, so the filter-graph parser never sees it and drawtext's own `%{…}` scanner is off — `'`, `%`, `:`, `,`, `[`, `]`, `;` and `\` all render verbatim. `escape_drawtext()` remains, for the font-**name** fallback only. `caption.py` renders through libass and already kept both characters; 1.15.0 adds the regression lock on that path.
- **No one-character orphan lines, and better breaks** (eval 14: `th1`, `dl3`, `dl1`). `caption.py`'s wrap gains two post-passes: a last line that is a single atom narrower than 1.1 em pulls the previous line's last atom down (the stranded Thai `ล` and Japanese `行`), and for spaced scripts the break is moved to the one that minimises the widest line instead of filling greedily (`"A third line the tool times for me"` now breaks between phrases). The line count never changes, non-spaced scripts keep greedy wrapping, and `report_layout()`'s one `cues:` line reports `rebalanced`.
- **`overlay.py --text` refuses a shaping script** instead of drawing it wrongly, naming `caption.py` and `graphics.py`. The ASS route for `overlay.py` is 1.16.0.
- **Every emoji PNG stayed on screen for one frame.** The overlay chain carried `eof_action=pass`, which switches off overlay's default "hold the last frame of the secondary input" — and a PNG input is a single frame at pts 0, so the asset was composited on frame 0 and vanished for the rest of the cue (the first `docs/demos/captions_emoji.gif` shipped an empty reserved gap as the feature's own advertisement). The chain now uses the default `eof_action=repeat` and lets `enable='between(t,start,end)'` confine the asset to its cue. The regression test renders a cue and samples the planned pixel in the **middle** of it and again after it ends.
- **A ZWJ no longer starts an emoji cluster.** U+200D ZWJ and U+200C ZWNJ are ordinary Indic/Persian orthography, so `क्‍ष` (ka + virama + ZWJ + ssa) was detected as the emoji cluster `94d-200d`: a Hindi cue was reported as containing emoji, warned about as monochrome, and on the PNG route had a real letter replaced by an invisible gap. A cluster may now only *start* at an emoji base (pictograph, regional indicator, or a `0-9 # *` that is actually followed by U+20E3); joiners, VS16 and skin-tone modifiers bind rightwards only. U+FE0E (VS15, text presentation) now means "not an emoji", so `❤︎` is drawn as a character.
- **Emoji in an RTL caption land in the reserved gap.** libass lays Arabic and Hebrew out right-to-left, so measuring the logical prefix from the left edge put the PNG on top of the text. The position is now measured from the rendered end of the line for `BIDI_SCRIPTS`, in `caption.py` and `graphics.py` alike.
- **`graphics.py` no longer claims `mode: mono` while drawing tofu, and `--emoji none` actually strips.** drawtext loads exactly one font file and has no fallback chain, so a monochrome emoji there is an empty box; an `auto` run with monochrome emoji is routed through libass (which does have a fallback chain) and a run pinned to `--text-render drawtext` degrades to `none` and says so. `--emoji none` now removes the clusters from `--name/--title/--subtitle/--text/--top/--bottom` the way `caption.py` does.
- **Drawn text goes to a private, cleaned-up temp file.** 1.15.0's first shape wrote every label into a world-shared, predictable `/tmp/ffmpeg-skill-text` created with `makedirs(exist_ok=True)` — an attacker-creatable directory with content-addressed names (a planted symlink was an arbitrary-file overwrite), a `PermissionError` out of filter construction for the second user of a shared box, and a directory that was never cleaned. The directory is now `tempfile.mkdtemp()` (0700, unguessable, removed at exit), the file is opened `O_NOFOLLOW` at 0600, and it is written only when the command naming it actually runs — so `--dry-run` writes nothing (the plan names the intended path) and the ASS route, which never reads the file, writes nothing either.
- **`--emoji-max 0` means none** (`int(args.emoji_max or 60)` swallowed it) in `caption.py` and `graphics.py`.
- **`--animate` fades the emoji with the line.** The PNG overlay gets an alpha fade matching the text's `\fad` (and `graphics.py`'s 0.3 s template fade) instead of popping in at full opacity.
- **The ASS route keeps `{`, `}` and `\`.** `ass_text()` deleted all three while the drawtext route now renders them verbatim, so the same title produced two different pictures depending on an automatic route choice. They are escaped (`\{`, `\}`, and a zero-width space where a backslash would otherwise start `\N`/`\n`/`\h`) rather than dropped — user text still cannot open an override block.
- **`doctor(detect=…)` is gone.** It was dead (`--static` only applies to `contract`, which never calls `doctor()`), and the test that exercised it went through the Python API rather than any CLI path; the replacement test asserts what is actually reachable, `contract --json --static`.

### Known

Carried into the next release, all P2 from the 1.15.0 review:

- `emoji_placeholder()`'s docstring is not a raw string, so the literal `\fsp`, `\r` and `\kf` in it become control characters in `help()`/`pydoc` output.
- `demos/build.py` draws its placeholder PNGs with `geq`, which needs a GPL build; the tests' own `_emoji_assets()` uses plain `color=…,format=rgba` and the demo could do the same.
- `emoji_support()` has two branches that both set `mode = "none"`; the `not fc_answered` one is dead code (the behaviour is right, the branch reads as if it were doing something).
- `text_overlay_ass(..., fonts_dir=…)` takes a parameter it never uses.
- `caption.py`'s no-emoji command reordered harmlessly (`-map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -vf …` → `-map 0:v:0 -vf … -map 0:a:0`) in the one path the release promises not to touch.

### Docs

- SKILL.md gains the report-label rule (a refusal that still delivers something is `Failed:`; the alternative goes in `Notes:`) and two gotcha lines, and drops the zh/ko restatement of the report shape and one redundant sentence to stay inside the 30 000-byte budget — now enforced by `tests/test_contract.py::test_skill_md_stays_under_the_30kb_budget` rather than by convention.
- `references/gotchas.md` gains an `### Emoji` section and two paragraphs on shaping under `### Fonts by script`; `docs/contract.md` documents `fonts.emoji`, the new flags and the new result keys (additive — `contract_version` stays 1.0); `references/scripts.md` updates the caption/graphics/overlay tables; `docs/design-decisions.md` pins the three calls behind this release; `docs/roadmap.md` marks 1.15.0 shipped and corrects the drawtext claim; the README gains two feature bullets and a pending-eval row.
- `demos/build.py` and `docs/demos.md` gain `captions_emoji` (colour PNGs against the monochrome fallback) and `lower_third_hindi` (`--text-render drawtext` against `--text-render ass`, the release's headline picture).
- `evals/agent_prompts_24.json` gains `em1`–`em4` and `sh1`–`sh2` with their fixtures, `evals/grade_runs_24.py` the honesty rule for the emoji prompts, and `evals/trigger/prompts.json` two more prompts (40: an emoji caption request that must trigger, an "emoji sticker pack as PNGs" near-miss that must not).
- `tests/fixtures/mcp_tools.json` regenerated: `caption`, `graphics` and `overlay` gain `emoji`, `emoji_assets`, `emoji_max` and `emoji_scale`; `graphics` also gains `text_render` and `write_ass`. Nothing was removed, renamed or made required.

## 1.14.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.13.0._

### Added

- **One delivery table** (`scripts/_platforms.py`, internal — the public tool count is unchanged at 42). Every destination is described once: frame, fps, the compliance spec `check.py` reports (duration, aspects, minimum height, fps, codecs, size, LUFS, true peak, SDR-only), the fraction of the frame the app's own UI covers, caption defaults, the export preset and the check platform. `check.py`'s `SPECS` and `export.py`'s `PRESETS`/`PLATFORM_OF` are now built from it — each platform preset's frame and duration cap included — so the loudness `export.py --normalize` hits, the frame it writes, the cap it trims at and the spec `check.py` enforces are the same numbers by construction (two presets deliberately differ and say so in the code: `youtube4k` is YouTube at 2160p, and no `youtube*` preset trims at YouTube's 12-hour limit). The alias map (`youtube-shorts`/`yt-shorts` → `shorts`, `yt` → `youtube`, `instagram`/`ig` → `reels`, `twitter` → `x`, `fb` → `facebook`) is accepted by `check.py --platform`, `export.py --preset`, `caption.py`/`graphics.py`/`overlay.py --platform`, `look.py --safe` and `render.py --template` alike, and those tools now offer one platform vocabulary rather than three. Existing platform rows and preset command lines are byte-for-byte what they were.
- **Delivery templates**: `render.py --template tiktok INPUT [--cues cues.txt | --srt subs.srt] [--logo] [--title] [--brand] [--chapters] [--fit crop|pad|blur] [-o OUT]` fills a project shipped in `templates/` and renders it — frame and fit, captions sized and placed clear of the platform's UI, loudness, the platform export preset and that platform's `check.py` in one command. Templates ship for `tiktok`, `reels`, `shorts`, `youtube-shorts`, `youtube`, `x`, `linkedin`, `facebook` and `podcast` (audio: silence trim, −16 LUFS, chapters when given, the podcast check). `--list-templates` prints them with their frames, limits and safe zones; `--write-project FILE` writes the filled project for editing and renders nothing; an unknown name is refused (`kind: input`) with the list.
- **The social pack**: `render.py --template all INPUT` (or `--template tiktok,reels,x`) renders every named destination from the same edit into `<stem>_<platform>.mp4` next to the input (`.m4a` for an audio-only destination, and `--chapters` reaches it), runs each platform's own check, and writes `<stem>_pack.md` with one table row per destination (file, size, duration, check). Under `--dry-run` the pack prints every child's planned commands and its table reads `planned` with no size or duration, since nothing was encoded and nothing was verified. `report.py --pack <stem>_pack.md` renders that table as an HTML page.
- **Real presets per destination**: `export.py --preset tiktok|shorts|linkedin|facebook` are their own entries rather than aliases of `reels`/`youtube`, each with its platform's frame, duration limit and loudness spec. `--preset youtube-hdr` writes HEVC Main10 keeping the source's own HDR10/HLG tags and refuses an SDR source (`kind: input`, pointing at `--preset youtube`) instead of labelling SDR as HDR; `--preset youtube-av1` encodes AV1 with SVT-AV1 (libaom fallback) and refuses with `kind: missing_tool` on a build that has neither. `check.py --platform facebook` is new.
- **Text stays out of the app's UI**: `caption.py --platform NAME`, `graphics.py --platform NAME` and `overlay.py --platform NAME` (so a template's `--logo` clears TikTok's status bar instead of landing 24 px under it) take their margins from that destination's safe zone (TikTok covers the bottom 22 % with its description block and the right 14 % with the like column; Reels 20 %/12 %, Shorts 18 %/12 %; the feed destinations keep a 5 % title-safe border). An explicit `--margin` (new on `graphics.py`) or `--position` wins. `render.py` passes `--platform` only for projects filled from a template, so a hand-written project is unchanged. `look.py --safe NAME` shades those zones on the sheet or frame, so "is the caption readable" can be checked against the app and not just the file.
- `fit.py --fit blur`: reach an aspect with the whole picture centred on a blurred, darkened (`eq brightness=-0.15`) copy of itself — nothing cropped, no black bars. The darkening is SDR-only: an `eq` on PQ/HLG code values is not the same perceptual dim, so an HDR source keeps an undimmed (and un-tone-mapped) blurred background, with one `info` line saying so. Templates ask for it as `"frame": {"aspect": "9:16", "fit": "blur"}`, or `render.py --template tiktok clip.mp4 --fit blur`. `render.py` projects now accept `"frame": {"fit": ...}`.
- `graphics.py --template sticker|hook|meme`: a filled chip of `--text` that pops in at `--position` (the social sticker), the full-width opening card (`--title --duration 3`) with a thin progress bar along the top that empties as the card's time runs out, and the classic meme layout (`--top`/`--bottom`, upper-case white with a heavy black outline). All three work inside a `render.py` project's `graphics[]` — which now takes `text`, `top`, `bottom`, `duration`, `margin` and `platform` alongside the older keys — and honour `--platform`'s safe zone.
- `render.py` projects may carry `"template"` (the template they were filled from) and audio-only deliveries now carry their intermediates through the audio container instead of `.mp4`, which is what makes the podcast template render end to end from a `.wav`.

### Docs
- SKILL.md gains the delivery-template rows and the safe-zone gotcha, `references/scripts.md` a templates section with the safe-zone table, `docs/contract.md` the delivery-table shape, what is derived from it and the new arguments, `references/gotchas.md` a "Platform safe zones" section (the target of SKILL.md's safe-zone pointer), and the README a "Deliver to a platform" example. `demos/build.py` and `docs/demos.md` gain two demos: `fit_blur` and `template_tiktok`. `docs/roadmap.md` marks 1.14.0 done and renumbers the remaining themes.
- `tests/fixtures/mcp_tools.json` regenerated: `render` gains `template`, `list_templates`, `cues`, `srt`, `logo`, `title`, `brand`, `chapters`, `fit`, `output` and `write_project`; `caption`, `graphics` and `overlay` gain `platform` (and `graphics` also `margin`, `text`, `top`, `bottom`, `duration`); `look` gains `safe`; `report` gains `pack`. Nothing was removed, renamed or made required.

## 1.13.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.12.0._

### Added

- **`audio.py --voice` takes a strength**: `--voice light|medium|strong`, with a bare `--voice` meaning `medium` — byte for byte the chain it has always produced, so existing calls and MCP requests are unchanged. `light` is `highpass=f=80,acompressor=threshold=-18dB:ratio=2:attack=5:release=80:makeup=1` (rumble and level only, for a good room); `medium` is `highpass=f=80,deesser=i=0.4,afftdn=nf=-25:tn=1,acompressor=threshold=-18dB:ratio=3:attack=5:release=80:makeup=2`; `strong` is `medium` followed by `deesser=i=0.6,acompressor=threshold=-24dB:ratio=4:attack=5:release=120:makeup=3,alimiter=limit=0.891251:level=disabled`, for phone and laptop audio.
- **The ducking parameters are sayable**: `--duck-threshold DB` (default −26.02 dBFS, the 0.05 linear the bed has used since 1.4, so the default filter string is unchanged), `--duck-attack MS` (20) and `--duck-release MS` (400) next to the existing `--duck-amount`. `--json` gains an `audio` block reporting the voice level, the stereo width, the effects bed and the duck settings the run actually used.
- `audio.py --stereo-widen 0..1` widens the stereo image (`extrastereo=m=1+2*amount`), applied after the channel layout is settled. It needs a real stereo source and says so: widening scales the side signal (L−R), which is exactly zero once a mono track has been duplicated to two identical channels, so a 1-channel input is refused (`kind: input`) whether or not `--stereo` is given, and more than two channels are refused unless `--downmix` folds them to stereo first — in which case the widening runs on the fold-down. Nothing is downmixed implicitly.
- `audio.py --effects FILE` / `--effects-volume DB` mixes a third track (sound effects, atmos) into the bed. It is never ducked: effects are cut to the picture, so dipping them under speech would move them off their own frames.
- `loudness.py --json` now reports the loudness range on both sides (`measured.input_lra` for the input, `result.input_lra` for the written file) and echoes the requested `targets` (lufs, tp, lra); `--lra N` is documented in `references/scripts.md` and the README.
- `check.py --platform podcast` gains two informational rows: `chapters` (PASS when the container carries at least one marker, WARN `none` otherwise, with `metadata.py --chapters` as the fix) and `channels` (PASS for mono or stereo, WARN above — podcast players downmix 5.1 unpredictably). Neither can FAIL a delivery and neither appears for another platform.
- **`render.py` project keys**: `"audio": {"stems": {"dialogue": DB, "music": DB, "effects": DB}}` names one level per element of the mix, mapping to `--gain`, `--music-volume` and `--effects-volume` (an explicit flag next to a stem wins; a stems `effects` level with no `"audio": {"effects": "sfx.wav"}` file is refused), and `"chapters"` — a chapters file path or an inline list of `{"at": TIME, "title": STR}` — runs `metadata.py` on the delivered file as the last stage before `check`, so the markers are in the file that ships. The stage plans like every other one: `--dry-run`/`--plan` prints the `metadata.py` command and lists `chapters` in `stages`, so the plan the user approves is the run. `"audio": {"voice": "light"|"medium"|"strong"}` picks the voice strength; `true` still means `medium`. Both new objects are validated against the project schema, so a misspelled stem or chapter key is refused by name.
- **The audio guards say what is missing** instead of ignoring it: a duck parameter (`--duck-threshold`, `--duck-attack`, `--duck-release`, `--duck-amount`) without `--duck`, and `--duck` without `--music`, are refused (`kind: input`) the way a typed dynamics parameter without its switch already was. In a `render.py` project, an `audio.stems.music` level with no `"music"` file is refused like `stems.effects` without an `"effects"` file, and `chapters` entries (a missing `at` or `title`, a chapters file that does not exist) are validated before the first ffmpeg call rather than after the render has already delivered an unchaptered file.
- `tests/fixtures/mcp_tools.json` regenerated: `audio` gains `duck_threshold`, `duck_attack`, `duck_release`, `stereo_widen`, `effects` and `effects_volume` and `voice` becomes a `light|medium|strong` enum. A client still sending the 1.12 boolean `{"voice": true}` keeps working: `true` is the bare flag, which is `medium`; `docs/contract.md` and `audio.py --help` say so.

### Docs
- **Not shipped: a `loudness.py --dialogue` speech gate.** `loudnorm`'s EBU R128 integrated measurement already applies the −70 LUFS absolute and −10 LU relative gates, so gating the measurement on speech spans moved the result by at most 0.6 LU on every fixture (including one that is half digital silence) — inside `check.py`'s own ±1 LU tolerance — for the cost of a second decode pass. `references/gotchas.md#loudness-and-ambience` records it.
- `docs/roadmap.md` marks 1.13.0 done and records the decision **not** to add `audio.py --chapters`: `metadata.py episode.mp4 --chapters chapters.txt` already writes chapter markers with every stream copied, and a second spelling inside a tool that re-encodes the audio would be the worse one. `render.py`'s `chapters` key is the project-level answer instead.

## 1.12.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.11.1._

### Added

- **Fonts by script.** `caption.py`, `graphics.py` and `overlay.py --text` detect the writing system of the text they are about to draw (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, Thai, Cyrillic, Greek) and resolve a font file that actually covers it — `fc-list :lang=xx` on Linux/macOS, the known system fonts on Windows — printing one line: `font: /usr/share/fonts/.../wqy-zenhei.ttc (covers ko)`. A machine where fontconfig reports no font for the script **fails the job** (`kind: input`, with per-OS install hints) instead of writing a video full of empty boxes that ffmpeg reports as a success; a machine with no working fontconfig at all is `unknown`, not `missing`, and the job runs with the font as given behind one info line. An explicit `--font`, an explicit `--font-file`, or a font your brand file itself names is always kept (a brand file that never mentions a font is not a choice — the script still picks one); when fontconfig says the stated font does not cover the text, one info line says so. `caption.py --fonts-dir` is searched first and checked with `fc-scan`: a directory that does not cover the script gets one line and a font resolved by script anyway.
- `--lang XX` on `caption.py` (an alias of the existing `--language`, which keeps tagging the subtitle stream under `--mode mux` and setting `--transcribe`'s language) and on `graphics.py`, plus `"lang"` in brand.json: the hint that says whether Han-only text is Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Everything else is read from the characters.
- `doctor`'s `fonts` capability gains `scripts`: `available` / `missing` / `unknown` per writing system with the font file it would use, so "can this machine render Korean captions" is answered before the job. The plain-text `doctor` summarises it on one line and stays short.
- **Captions people can read.** Every cue is wrapped to the safe area by measured width — a per-character table for Latin (read off DejaVu Sans, so a line of capitals measures as wide as it draws), a full em per CJK/Thai character, 0.6 for Arabic/Hebrew, 0.7 for Devanagari, and nothing at all for a combining mark, which never gets separated from the character it belongs to (Thai tone marks and vowel signs, Devanagari matras, Arabic and Hebrew points). Lines break between characters for CJK/Thai and at spaces otherwise. `--max-lines N` (default 2) splits a cue that needs more lines into consecutive cues sharing its time; `--min-duration S` (default 1.0) holds a flashed cue longer, never past the next cue's start; `--offset TIME` shifts every cue for `--text`, `--srt` and `--ass` and takes the skill's timestamp grammar (seconds, `mm:ss`, `hh:mm:ss.ms`, SMPTE `hh:mm:ss:ff`, with a leading `-` for earlier). One `cues:` line reports what changed, and a file you passed in is never edited in place — the adjusted copy is written next to the output and burned instead. Under `--dry-run`/`--plan` the planned command names that same copy and the plan records where it comes from, while nothing is written until the real run. `--min-duration`/`--offset` also work with `--write-srt` alone; `--max-lines` needs the input video, whose frame size sets the line width.
- `--karaoke` uses real per-word timings when the transcript has them (a whisper `<stem>.json` / `<stem>.words.json` next to the SRT), falling back to the existing energy or even split.
- brand.json `styles.caption` (`{font, size, colour, box, position}`, either spelling of colour) — one caption look shared by `caption.py` and, for `font` and `colour`, `graphics.py`. The older top-level `caption` block still works and still carries the burn-in-only defaults.
- `render.py` projects pass `lang`, `offset`, `max_lines` and `min_duration` through to the captions stage, and `lang` to a graphics entry.

### Changed

- `doctor`'s plain `fonts:` line carries the default font's `detail` in brackets when the status is not `available` and the detail is short enough to keep the line to one screen width; longer detail stays `--json` only.
- `references/gotchas.md` on RTL: `caption.py` shapes and reorders Arabic and Hebrew by construction (everything it draws goes through libass); `drawtext` (`overlay.py --text`, `graphics.py`) does too on a build with `--enable-libfribidi`/`--enable-libharfbuzz`, and only an older build draws unjoined logical order.
- **The audio guards say what is missing** instead of ignoring it: a duck parameter (`--duck-threshold`, `--duck-attack`, `--duck-release`, `--duck-amount`) without `--duck`, and `--duck` without `--music`, are refused (`kind: input`) the way a typed dynamics parameter without its switch already was. In a `render.py` project, an `audio.stems.music` level with no `"music"` file is refused like `stems.effects` without an `"effects"` file, and `chapters` entries (a missing `at` or `title`, a chapters file that does not exist) are validated before the first ffmpeg call rather than after the render has already delivered an unchaptered file.
- `tests/fixtures/mcp_tools.json` regenerated: `caption` gains `language` (spelled `--lang` too), `offset`, `max_lines`, `min_duration`; `graphics` gains `lang`.

### Docs
- Correction to the 1.11.1 entry: iteration 11's agents did not read `references/gotchas.md` or `references/scripts.md` (0 of 36 and 2 of 36 actual reads; the earlier counts matched the file names inside SKILL.md's own text). What 1.11.1 changed in practice, measured in iteration 12: `doctor` before a job 23 of 36 runs → 0, `--json-brief` on a writing step 4 of 36 → 23. Tokens per run are flat (72.2k → 71.8k) because about 64k of every run is the harness's own context, not the skill.

## 1.11.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.11.0._

### Changed
- SKILL.md tells the agent that the file is enough to do a job and that `references/scripts.md` / `references/gotchas.md` cost as much to read as SKILL.md itself, so they are opened only for a question the file leaves open; step 0 no longer suggests `doctor` before the first job of a session, only after a failure or when the user asks. Eval iteration 11 measured why: at 1.11.0 agents read `gotchas.md` in 31 of 36 runs (0 of 106 at 1.10.0), `scripts.md` in 36 of 36 (73 of 106) and ran `doctor` in 31 of 36 (41 of 106), so the mean run cost 72.2k tokens against 68.7k at 1.10.0 despite the smaller SKILL.md.

- docs: eval iteration 11 at 1.11.0 (36 prompts, tokens per run measured) (#214)
- docs: the token diet shipped as 1.11.0 (feat PR → minor); roadmap themes move up one, 1.10.2 mentions renamed (#213)

## 1.11.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.10.1._

### Changed

- **SKILL.md is two-tier** (token diet, 1.11.0): 362 lines / 37.8 KB → 198 lines / 29.1 KB with no rule removed. The long "Things that look right but are wrong" and "Gotchas" prose, and the audio-only recipe table, moved to the new `references/gotchas.md`; SKILL.md keeps one line per item with a `references/gotchas.md#anchor` pointer.
- **Workflow guidance that saves calls**: run `_contract.py doctor` only before the first job on a new machine or after a `kind: missing_tool` failure (not per job); no separate `probe.py` before every edit, because every writing tool's `--json` already carries the input and a probe of the output; use `render.py` with a project.json for jobs of three or more steps; verify with `look.py --tiles 3x2` (or `--at T`), keeping the full 4x3 sheet for jobs about layout across the whole clip.
- `python3 scripts/_contract.py doctor` without `--json` prints counts and what is missing instead of the full capability list (1681 → 522 bytes on a healthy machine). `doctor --json` is unchanged.

### Added

- `--json-brief` on every tool: the same success document as `--json`, trimmed to `status`, `output`, `dry_run`, `verified`, a compact `summary` (`duration_s`, `width`, `height`, `fps`, `vcodec`, `acodec`, `channels`, and `lufs` when the tool measured one), the tool's own keys and the count of commands instead of the command lines — 2372 → 784 bytes for a `cut.py` run. It implies `--json`; `--json`'s own output is unchanged; failures print the same failure document as today.
- `contract --json`: `supports_json_brief` per tool, mirroring the measured `supports_json`. The MCP `tools/list` schema gains the `json_brief` argument on every tool (an addition; the frozen 1.x snapshot was regenerated).
- feat: token diet — two-tier SKILL.md, --json-brief on every tool, call-saving workflow guidance, short doctor summary (#212)

## 1.10.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.10.0._

### Fixed

- `render.py` now refuses an unrecognised key in a project — top level or in any stage/clip object — naming the object, the key and the nearest valid key, instead of silently ignoring it (a clip `start`/`end` typo rendered the clip untrimmed; a stage typo dropped the stage, both reported as success).
- `write_plan()` and the at-exit plan hook use the `Context` `emit()`/`die()` were given: `emit(ctx=…)` no longer writes an empty plan, and `die(ctx=…)` no longer leaves a plan behind for a failed run.
- The nine tools that declared `--crf` without a help string now show the `(deprecated: use --quality)` mark in `--help` (and in their MCP `crf` description).
- The `--crf` deprecation warning fires for the abbreviations argparse accepts (`--cr`, `--c`) as well, and `batch.py` no longer swallows a recipe step's warning; `export.py` stays exempt.
- A non-numeric time says `'zz': not a time` instead of leaking the interpreter's `could not convert string to float`.
- docs/contract.md: `tools/list` under `FFMPEG_SKILL_MCP_LEAN` is stable in tool and argument names and `required` lists — what the frozen snapshot pins — not byte-identical (descriptions may change).
- SKILL.md: the time-grammar sentence is scoped to the timestamp flags (`--start`/`--end`/`--at`/`--from`/`--duration`/`--offset` and cue/chapter files); `doctor`'s tool list is `doctor --json`'s `tools`.
- references/scripts.md notes the `--crf` deprecation and `FFMPEG_SKILL_NO_OVERWRITE`; README marks `proxy.py --crf` as the deprecated alias.
- fix: render.py refuses unknown project keys, ctx= reaches write_plan and the exit hook, --crf mark on every tool with --quality, time refusals say not a time (#211)
- docs: eval iteration 10 at 1.10.0, README catches up with 1.8-1.10, PR checklist names the README (#210)

## 1.10.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.9.1._

### Deprecated

Announced per docs/contract.md's three-step policy (also in `contract --json`'s new top-level
`deprecated` list and in docs/contract.md's "What 2.0 changes"); everything below keeps working
unchanged in 1.x and is removed in 2.0.0:

- The per-tool v1 success keys next to `result_v2` (`output`, `probe`, `commands`, `verified`,
  `verification` and each tool's own top-level keys) — use `result_v2` (`FFMPEG_SKILL_RESULT_V2=1`).
- `--crf` as an alias of `--quality` on every re-encoding tool that takes `--quality` (`export.py`
  keeps `--crf`: its preset chooses the encoder) — use `--quality N`; `--crf` now
  prints a one-line stderr warning when it is passed explicitly and is marked in `--help`.
- `json` and `progress` in the MCP `inputSchema` — the transport sets them itself;
  `FFMPEG_SKILL_MCP_LEAN=1` drops them from `tools/list` today (opt-in, default unchanged).
- `probe`'s `hdr` meaning "BT.2020 primaries or a PQ/HLG transfer" — use `hdr_signal`; 2.0 renames.
- Overwriting an existing output with only a warning — pass `--overwrite`, or set
  `FFMPEG_SKILL_NO_OVERWRITE=1` (the recommended agent setting) for the 2.0 behaviour today.

### Other

- `run()`, `emit()`, `die()` and `info()` accept an optional `ctx=` Context (issue #189 B); `STATE`
  stays the default instance, so no tool changes behaviour. 2.0 makes the argument required.
- feat: deprecated list in the contract, ctx= on run/emit/die/info, FFMPEG_SKILL_MCP_LEAN, NO_OVERWRITE as the agent setting, eval-9 follow-ups (#209)
- docs: eval iteration 9 at 1.9.0 (108 runs, independent grader, trigger set) (#208)

## 1.9.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.9.0._

- fix: @fps in caption cue files, one @ only, time_arg() in metadata/multicam/speedramp, render normalize default documented (#207)

## 1.9.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.8.1._

- One time grammar (issue #189 B, docs/design-decisions.md "Time grammar", roadmap 1.9.0): `broll.py`, `cut.py` and `freeze.py` now parse their times through `time_arg()` like every other tool, so a bad or fps-less value is `kind: input` naming the flag; `hh:mm:ss:ff@fps` (e.g. `00:01:02:15@29.97`) names a timecode's rate explicitly and is accepted by every time-taking flag and cue file. `references/scripts.md` documents the grammar once.
- Eval 8 follow-ups. `render.py` turns `--normalize` on by default for a platform export preset when the project has no `loudness` stage (`"normalize": false` opts out); SKILL.md shows the Japanese shape of the report next to the English one, lists a `join.py` that scaled or padded a clip under the Look rule, and says when `--codec` / `--quality` are the right call.
- `probe` gains `hdr_signal` (true only for a PQ / HLG transfer or Dolby Vision) next to `hdr`, which keeps counting BT.2020 primaries on an SDR transfer until 2.0 renames it (issue #189 A1, pre-shipped as a parallel key).
- feat: one time grammar (@fps, time_arg in broll/cut/freeze), probe hdr_signal, eval-8 follow-ups (#206)

## 1.8.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.8.0._

- Seventh review (the 1.8.0 encoder flags and `--normalize`). `export.py --normalize` wrote its temporary file under `loudness.py`'s own default output name and destroyed a pre-existing `<output>_loudnorm.<ext>` (P0; now a private per-process name, no forced overwrite, and the normalising encode is in `commands`); `--normalize` on a preset without a loudness spec is `kind: input` and under `--dry-run` says what it would do; `--codec prores` without `-o` failed inside ffmpeg (refused with the `.mov` hint); `waveform.py` ignored `--codec`; `cut.py --codec` on the lossless path kept the source codec (switches to `--accurate`, said so); `export.py` no longer advertises `--codec` in the contract; duplicated `encoder:libx265` optional capabilities merged; `x264_args(keep_bt709=False)` honoured under `--codec`; HDR HEVC `--quality 50/51` no longer overflows CRF; the `--crf` range message names the av1 bound; `check.py` tags `true peak` as a judgement row.
- Eval 8 follow-ups. SKILL.md says how to run doctor (`python3 scripts/_contract.py doctor --json`; two runs looked for a doctor.py); `render.py --init` writes `"normalize": true` on the export stage; the ProRes rule says `-o NAME.mov` explicitly.
- fix: seventh review (--normalize temp name, --codec edges, contract) and eval-8 follow-ups (#204)
- docs: evals iteration 8 at 1.8.0 (108 runs, independent grader, trigger set) (#205)

## 1.8.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.7.2._

- `--codec h264|hevc|av1|prores` and `--quality N` on every tool that re-encodes (issue #189 B, pre-shipped from the 2.0 decision in docs/design-decisions.md). One resolver, `_common.encoder_args()`: hevc keeps HDR sources Main10 with their tags and writes 8-bit BT.709 for SDR; av1 uses SVT-AV1 (libaom fallback), 10-bit for HDR; prores is 422 HQ and needs a `.mov`/`.mkv` output; h264 refuses HDR (`kind: input`, the hint names `color.py --to-sdr`). `--quality` is the CRF scale and overrides `--crf`; without `--codec` nothing changes (x264 for SDR, x265 for HDR). `export.py` keeps its presets and refuses `--codec`. The contract lists the encoder each `--codec` value needs under the tool's optional capabilities.
- feat: --codec h264|hevc|av1|prores and --quality on every re-encoding tool, resolved in encoder_args() (#203)
- docs: roadmap from 1.7.1 to 1.20.0 and what 2.0 removes (#201)

## 1.7.2

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.7.1._

- `check.py` without `--platform` assumes youtube and reports the judgement rows (duration, aspect, fps, resolution, loudness, true peak) as WARN with a `notes` line, not FAIL: a run that only wanted the format rows no longer fails on levels it was not asked about (eval 7). A named platform is unchanged.
- `render.py`: `"export": {"preset": ..., "normalize": true}` forwards `--normalize`, so a project renders a platform-compliant file in one export.
- fix: check.py judgement rows are WARN without a named platform; render.py export.normalize (#202)

## 1.7.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.7.0._

- Eval iteration 7 follow-ups. `export.py --normalize` runs `loudness.py` on the written file when a platform preset's loudness spec is missed (audio re-encoded, video copied), so a platform export is one call instead of export, loudness, export again. `render.py` fills `frame.width/height` from the export preset when the project gives only an aspect of the same shape, so captions and overlays are burned at the delivery size instead of the source's short side (406x720 before a 1080x1920 reels export). SKILL.md: the report language is the language the request is written in, not a language it talks about or the language of an error (six English refusals came back in Spanish or Portuguese); the five report labels hold for the shortest failure too.
- fix: eval-7 follow-ups -- export --normalize, render frame from the export preset, report language and labels on failures (#200)
- docs: evals iteration 7 at 1.7.0 (108 runs, independent grader, trigger set) (#199)

## 1.7.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.6.0._

- Sixth review (plan and verified edges). `loudness.py` said `verified: true` after missing its target by several LU (the step's `ok` now reflects the target); `--plan` on `probe`/`scenes`/`sync`/`silence`/`cropdetect`/`loudness --measure-only` wrote nothing (a plan is now written at exit when the tool never reached `emit()`); `verify.py --plan` ran the whole chain for real (refused); a plan bound only the `-i` files, so an SRT, LUT, recipe or still could change underneath it (argv files and filter-read files are fingerprinted too); `render.py plan.json` failed hard on a platform check the direct command reports as `verified: false` (aligned); `render.py --plan` produced an unrunnable plan (refused, the project is the plan); a vanished plan `cwd`, a non-object JSON and a string `argv` are `kind: input` instead of a silent relocation or a traceback; the `plan` key is in every tool's output schema.
- Every writing tool's `--json` document now says what it verified itself: `verification` (probe; `loudness` for `loudness.py` and `export.py`'s platform presets; `check` for `render.py`) and `verified`, true only when the artifact was written, probed and every self-check met its target (issue #189 C, "verify as part of the contract"). `export.py` whose file misses the platform's loudness spec stays `completed` with `verified: false`.
- feat: every writing tool reports what it verified (verified, verification); sixth-review fixes to the plan edges (#197)
- docs: record the 2.0 design decisions (time grammar, encoder abstraction, Context) (#198)

## 1.6.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.5.2._

- `--plan FILE` on every tool: the dry run written as a plan (tool, argv, fingerprinted inputs, commands, expected output, verify steps) that `render.py FILE` executes later, refusing if an input changed since the plan was made and running the verify steps (probe, `check` for a platform) afterwards. "Plan → user confirms → execute" is one round trip (issue #189 C).
- feat: --plan FILE writes the dry run as a plan that render.py executes (#196)

## 1.5.2

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.5.1._

- Eval iteration 6 follow-ups. `overlay.py --fade` without `--end` no longer fades the overlay out again at the end of the clip (fade-in only; the fade-out belongs to `--end`). `export.py`'s platform presets (youtube / youtube4k / reels / x) measure the written file and report `loudness` with the platform's target plus a `notes` line naming the `loudness.py` call when it is outside the spec, so an agent plans one pass instead of two. `cut.py` reports `lossless_alternative` (the nearest keyframe `--start`) when the snap forced a re-encode. SKILL.md: a one-command job still gets its `Done:`/`Steps:` lines in the user's language.
- fix: eval-6 follow-ups -- fade-in-only --fade, export measures platform loudness, cut names the lossless alternative, report language on short jobs (#195)

## 1.5.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.5.0._

- Fifth review. `render.py` refused nothing when `output` named one of its own clip sources and overwrote the source (now `kind: input`); `fit.py --method trim` stream-copied a subtitle track through the `-ss` cut, so the file came out at twice the requested length with cues from the wrong part (dropped and reported like `pad --start`); `caption.py --transcribe` ran the speech engine and wrote the `.srt` under `--dry-run`, and put that sidecar next to the *input*, silently replacing a hand-written one (now planned only, written next to the output, with a warning before replacing); `color.py --correct --dry-run` ran two real signalstats passes; `multicam.py --audio N` out of range was a traceback; `check.py`'s fix for a broadcast codec failure named a preset that does not exist (`prores` now); `sequence.py` had `import re` above its shebang, so its docstring never reached `--help` or the contract; `batch.py --watch` could not be stopped with Ctrl-C without an "interrupted, nothing written" exit; `render.py --dry-run` said "copied"; `join.py`'s audio path probed its output as an input; `references/scripts.md` described karaoke timing as even when the default follows speech energy (`--karaoke-timing`).
- fix: fifth review -- render self-overwrite, fit trim subtitles, caption transcribe under dry-run, and nine smaller items (#194)

## 1.5.0

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.15._

- `FFMPEG_SKILL_RESULT_V2=1` adds a `result_v2` key to every writing tool's `--json` success document: the uniform shape planned for 2.0 (`output`, `probe`, `commands`, `metrics`, `notes`, `dropped`, `details`), built in `emit()` from the keys tools already report (#189). Nothing moves without it.
(nothing yet)
- feat: opt-in result_v2 key previews the 2.0 success-document shape (#193)
- docs: record eval iteration 6 (1.4.15) (#192)

## 1.4.15

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.14._

- Policies settled after the boundary sweep. An ffmpeg failure now always exits 1 (ffmpeg's own code, which varied by build and stage, is `ffmpeg_returncode` in the JSON). `audio.py`, `loudness.py` and `proxy.py` keep a subtitle/data track the container can hold, as `fit`/`color`/`overlay` do; `join.py`, `broll.py` and `speedramp.py`, whose timeline moves, report `dropped_non_av_streams: true` when the source had one. The rule is written down in `docs/design-decisions.md`.
- fix: settle the ffmpeg exit-code and subtitle-track policies (#191)

## 1.4.14

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.13._

- Boundary sweep (561 runs, 42 tools × 23 inputs). Two runs writing the same output at once both reported `completed` while one of them described the other's file: `run()` now holds a lock file (`.<name>.ffskill-lock`, pid inside) next to the output and the second run is refused as `kind: input`; a lock whose pid is dead or older than an hour is taken over.
- Odd source dimensions (641x359 screen captures, 4:4:4 masters) failed 15 tools with "width not divisible by 2": `run()` retries the encode with an even-dimension scale in front of the filter chain; a `-filter_complex` graph that cannot take it is refused as `kind: input` with the fix named.
- `cut.py`'s re-encode path and `pad.py --start` stream-copied a subtitle track whose cues then fired early (cut's container grew to 2 s for a 1 s cut): both drop it and report `dropped_non_av_streams`, as `fit`/`freeze` already did. `cut.py` counts a keyframe snap of exactly the tolerance as outside it.
- `render.py --dry-run` planned ten commands for a clip whose source does not exist; the source is checked first. `render.py` and `report.py` answered an unwritable output directory with a traceback; an unwritable directory is now refused as `kind: input` by every writing tool before ffmpeg runs. `verify.py --json` printed two JSON documents for a non-media input.
- `color.py --correct` / `--lut` on an HDR source tagged PQ/HLG pixels as BT.709 without a tone map: refused as `kind: input` naming `--to-sdr` (`--force` grades the raw values anyway). `redact.py --mode blur` failed on regions under 40 px with the default radius (clamped, chroma planes get their own). `loudness.py --measure-only --json` prints the contract's document shape.
- Sweep P3s: `export.py`'s HDR warning is in the JSON (`notes`); `graphics.py` refuses a frame under 64 px instead of building a 0-height bar; `insert.py` refuses a video where it wants a still; `look.py` builds a sheet from a one-frame clip instead of printing "wrote" and then failing; `batch.py --dry-run` leaves no directories behind and `render.py` removes its auto-named work directory on every exit path.
- fix: boundary sweep -- output lock, even-dimension retry, subtitle drops in cut/pad, unwritable dirs, dry-run source check, verify single JSON, redact radius, HDR refusal in color, and the P3s (#190)

## 1.4.13

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.12._

- Fourth review, P3: `render.py` no longer re-encodes a clip whose `speed` is 1.0; a brand's `caption.animate` default is ignored over `--mode mux` instead of making it fail; `shell_quote` quotes newlines so the `commands` log stays copy-pasteable; `reverse.py` warns that a clip over 60 s is buffered whole in memory; `analyze_levels` scales 16-bit sources correctly (10 / 12 / 16-bit tiers); `sync.py`/`multicam.py --analyze-seconds` is capped at 900 s; the shared `--timeout`/`--overwrite` help is shorter, which trims every tool's MCP `inputSchema` (118 KB → 112 KB for `tools/list`); SKILL.md warns against burning captions at an intermediate size that `export.py` then upscales.
- fix: fourth-review P3 batch -- render speed 1.0, brand animation over mux, newline-safe command log, reverse warning, 16-bit levels, analyze-seconds ceiling, shorter common help (#188)

## 1.4.12

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.11._

- Fifth audit (100 items; 33 confirmed, 5 recorded decisions, 62 not reproduced). Fixed: `bit_depth` read `yuv410p` as 10-bit (the depth is the number that ends the pixel-format name); `audio.py --mono` halved an already-mono track (-6 dB) and now leaves 1-channel input alone and downmixes >2 channels through swresample; `sync.py --replace-audio` cut the reference to the length of a shorter or head-trimmed second file (`-t <reference>` + `apad` instead of `-shortest`); 25+ tools raised TypeError formatting a missing duration after a successful encode (`fmt_secs()`); energy karaoke gave the last word a negative `\kf` on a cue shorter than 5 cs per word; the karaoke energy decode ran outside `--timeout`; `render.py`'s final copy bypassed the output-path, overwrite and temp-staging guards (`place_output()`); the video `join.py` forced stereo and dropped the centre/LFE of 5.1 clips (the audio-only join already kept the widest layout); `multicam.py -shortest` could end before the cut list; ffprobe output that is not JSON is a `kind: ffmpeg` document, not a traceback; a git/vendor `ffprobe version N-...` string is mapped from the libavutil major (59 -> 7) instead of reading as 0.0, which on 7.1 skipped the BT.709 tagging workaround.
- `freeze.py --mode insert` drops a stream-copied subtitle track (its cues after the freeze fired early) and reports `dropped_non_av_streams`, as `fit.py --method speed` does; `sequence.py` sorts globbed frames naturally (`img2` before `img10`); `cut.py --segments` refuses a negative start; `speedramp.py --segment` accepts `mm:ss`; one `MEDIA_EXT` list (adds `.mxf`, `.m2ts`, `.3gp`, `.wmv`, `.aif`, `.caf`, `.wma`, `.webp`, so `verify` probes them); a colour alpha above 1 (`red@2`) is refused before ffmpeg; `--pad-fill blur` clamps the radius to what boxblur accepts on a tiny frame.
- Not changed, recorded decisions: BT.2020-primaries SDR takes the HDR path until 2.0 (docs/design-decisions.md); `join.py`/`broll.py` keep the HDR path for mixed inputs; `escape_drawtext` drops `'` and `%`; `--overwrite` warns until 2.0.
- fix: fifth audit -- bit depth, mono, replace-audio length, None durations, karaoke, render copy guards, 5.1 joins, multicam length, version fallback, freeze subtitles, natural frame order (#187)

## 1.4.11

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.10._

- An output that names a directory, or whose directory does not exist, is refused as `kind: input` before ffmpeg runs (it was `OUTPUT_INVALID` after the run, or the muxer's ENOENT as `kind: ffmpeg`).
- `batch.py` with a relative folder no longer doubles it in the default output directory (`bdir/bdir/out`).
- fix: output-path mistakes are kind input before ffmpeg runs; batch default outdir no longer doubles a relative folder (#185)

## 1.4.10

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.9._

- `loudness.py` holds its `--tp` ceiling in the file it writes, not just in loudnorm's float output: the written file is measured and, when a lossy encoder overshot (ffmpeg's AAC at 192k turned one transient of a 12-minute film from -2.4 to +3.7 dBFS, so `--tp -1` delivered +1.2 dBTP and `check.py`'s fix hint looped back), it re-encodes at 256k then 320k when `--audio-bitrate` was not pinned, then with the ceiling lowered by the overshoot. `result` carries `tp_ceiling_used`, `audio_bitrate_used`, `encodes` and a `note` when the loudness moved more than 1 LU.
- SIGINT/SIGTERM stop the running ffmpeg (or sibling script), remove its partial output and exit with a failure document (`kind: interrupted`, exit 130/143). Before, SIGTERM killed only the Python parent and ffmpeg carried on as an orphan finishing a file nobody verified; SIGINT was a traceback with the partial left on disk.
- A path with an apostrophe (`Ryo's Mac/cues.srt`, `lu't.cube`) reaches `subtitles=`, `ass=`, `lut3d=` and `fontsdir=` intact: `escape_filter_path` now writes the three backslashes the two-level filter parser needs for `'` (one was consumed as a quote, so ffmpeg opened `Ryos Mac/cues.srt`).
- fix: loudness holds --tp in the written file; SIGINT/SIGTERM stop ffmpeg cleanly; apostrophes in filter paths (#184)

## 1.4.9

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.8._

- README gains a "Gotchas and best practices" section for human readers: VFR, keyframe snapping, HDR, loudness targets, caption order, 9:16 crops, fonts, silence threshold, sync confidence, plans; every flag named is checked against the scripts' `--help`.
- `--dry-run` writes no side files either: `silence.py --edl`, `scenes.py --edl` and the `.ass` that `caption.py --animate/--karaoke` generates were written while stderr said "would write". The contract's note for these tools was right; the code was not.
- SMPTE `hh:mm:ss:ff` times resolve with the input's fps in every tool that takes a time (`overlay`, `graphics`, `look`, `insert`, `background`, `fit`, `loop`), and a bad time is a `kind: input` failure document naming the flag instead of a traceback (`time_arg()` in `_common.py`; `cut`/`freeze` already did this).
- `pad.py --start/--end` accept the shared time grammar (`1:30`) like every other tool; junk is a `kind: input` refusal, not an argparse exit 2 without JSON.
- `cut.py --segments` refuses an output that is the same file as its input. The run() guard compares each ffmpeg command's `-i` with its output, and the final concat's only `-i` is the temp list file, so `-o in.mp4` replaced the source with the join (fourth review, P0); the single-segment path already refused.
- The dry-run exception list in SKILL.md and `docs/contract.md` names `silence`, `loudness` and `stabilize` again; the pinning test now checks the sentence that states the exception in all three docs, not "the name appears somewhere in the file", which is how the list drifted twice.
- Release resolver: a PR labelled `dependencies` is never releasable, even when Dependabot also labelled it `major` (its bump of actions/checkout 4→7 was the action's major, not this package's, and blocked the 1.4.9 release).

## 1.4.8

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.7._

- Multi-segment `cut.py` writes its concat list with forward slashes, so a Windows temp path (`C:\Users\...`) is not read as escape sequences by the concat demuxer; `sequence.py` shares the helper.
- SMPTE `hh:mm:ss:ff` parsing counts frames per timecode-second like `fmt_smpte_time()` does, so the two agree at 29.97/59.94 over long files. `cut.py` passes the input's fps (so SMPTE works there) and refuses a bad time as `kind: input`; `freeze.py --at` accepts the shared time grammar.
- `caption.py --transcribe`: faster-whisper runs under `--timeout` like the CLI engines; an old whisper.cpp binary named `main` is used when it lives in a whisper directory.
- `bin/install.js` moves the old install aside and back on a failed swap, so an upgrade never leaves the target empty; the npm package and installer ship `docs/contract.md`.
- `join.py` goes 10-bit HEVC when any input is HDR (not only the first); `broll.py` keeps a 10-bit cutaway over an HDR main clip; `grid.py` notes that an HDR input is composited into an 8-bit SDR grid.
- `look.py -o` names the file for a single `--at` when it carries an image extension; `audio.py` refuses `--mono` with `--stereo` and an out-of-range `--denoise-strength`; `render.py` refuses a negative clip speed; `batch.py` also picks up `.ogg`/`.opus`/`.ts`/`.gif`/`.aac`/`.aiff`; `report.py` shows a 0 s duration as 0 s; `ffmpeg_version()` has a probe timeout.
- Windows: `default_font_file()` looks for the requested family in `C:\Windows\Fonts` (and common CJK system fonts for a CJK request) before falling back to Arial.
- fix: third audit's confirmed items — Windows concat lists, SMPTE round trip, ASR timeout, installer swap, HDR joins, argument checks, shipped docs (#181)

## 1.4.7

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.6._

- `--dry-run` plans rest on real measurements: `silence.py`, `loudness.py`, `check.py` and `stabilize.py` run their measurement passes (silencedetect, loudnorm pass 1, vidstabdetect) under `--dry-run` and skip only the write. Before, a dry run reported 0 silences, a made-up -20 LUFS, an unmeasured loudness row and no stabilisation pass. The contract lists them as `analysis_only`.
- `render.py`'s check stage and `report.py`'s look/loudness/check children receive the shared flags (`--timeout`, `--overwrite`, `--fast`, `--dry-run`); `render.py`'s failure document carries the output probe.
- `cropdetect.py` skips a sampled window ffmpeg cannot decode and measures the rest; only when every window fails is it `kind: ffmpeg`.
- `caption.py --text`/`--srt` and `batch.py`'s `recipe.project` read through the guarded reader: a missing, directory or non-UTF-8 file is a `kind: input` refusal naming the flag.
- fix: dry-run plans rest on real measurements; shared flags reach every child; guarded cue reads; cropdetect skips an undecodable window (#179)

## 1.4.6

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.5._

- `docs/design-decisions.md` lists behaviours that look like bugs but are decisions (timeout 0, dry-run measurements, BT.2020 handling, overwrite policy, `speed: 0`, packaging), each with its rationale and pinning test; `AGENTS.md`, CONTRIBUTING and the bug template point reviewers to it first.
- Docs: README no longer claims media ffmpeg calls have no timeout; tool counts read 42 everywhere (the count test now catches the "all N by" / "same N names" phrasings); `docs/contract.md` lists every dry-run exception; the error-kind list is identical in SKILL.md, README and the contract; SKILL.md states the dry-run exceptions once and moves the Windows drawtext story to `references/ci-platform-pitfalls.md`; CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md added.
- The npm package ships `references/scripts.md`, `devices.md` and `ci-platform-pitfalls.md` only; the maintainer diary `process-pitfalls.md` stays in the repository. Internal: the `Context` dict-style shims are gone, every call site uses attributes.
- Every sibling-script run (`render.py`/`batch.py`/`report.py` stages and the MCP server's dispatch) has an outer wall-clock ceiling of 4x the per-ffmpeg `--timeout` plus 60 s, so a child hung for a reason other than ffmpeg is killed and reported as `kind: timeout`. The MCP caller's `timeout` argument sets both.
- `scenes.py` and `sync.py` share one PCM decode and RMS-envelope implementation (`decode_pcm_mono`/`rms_envelope` in `_common.py`); results are unchanged.
- fix: outer wall-clock ceiling on every sibling-script run; scenes and sync share one PCM decode and envelope (#178)
- docs: add design-decisions record and AGENTS.md (#180)
- chore: attribute-only Context; ship only the agent-facing references in the npm package (#177)
- docs: remove the contradictions the 1.4.2 review found; count test catches more phrasings; code of conduct (#176)

## 1.4.5

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.4._

- `--preset` is an argparse choice of the x264 presets in every encoding tool (the contract and MCP schema carry the enum) and `--crf` is range-checked (0-51) before ffmpeg runs; a typo is a `kind: input` refusal, not an encoder error.
- `silence.py` says why nothing was found: with zero silences the result carries a `hint` with the track's measured mean/peak level and a threshold to try. `cut.py` names the nearest keyframes (`nearest_keyframes`) when a lossless cut had to re-encode, so the caller can move the cut instead. Failure JSON may carry `error.hint`.
- `broll.py --pad-color` is validated like every other colour flag (it was spliced into the filter graph unchecked; a value containing `,` could append a filter).
- The MCP server attaches the tool's own failure document as `structuredContent` on a failed call, so a caller reads `error.kind`/`code` instead of parsing prose.
- `render.py` re-raises a stage's own failure (kind, exit code, hint, `stage`) instead of reporting every child failure as `kind: input`; `report.py` shows "check could not run" instead of crashing when `check.py` fails to run; `--commands`/`--notes`/`--chapters` files that are missing or not UTF-8 are a `kind: input` refusal, not a traceback.
- SKILL.md: a failed or refused report keeps the five labels (`Look: not needed (nothing written)`), quotes `error.hint` in `Notes:`, and several open questions are asked as one bundled proposal instead of one per turn.
- fix: validate --preset/--crf before ffmpeg; silence.py and cut.py say what to change next; failure JSON may carry a hint (#175)

## 1.4.4

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.3._

- `check.py`, `render.py` (check stage), `batch.py` and `verify.py` report a failed result as `status: failed` with the new `kind: verification` (`VERIFICATION_FAILED`, exit 1) and keep their detail fields (`checks`, `check`, `results`, `files`); before, they printed `status: completed` next to a non-zero exit code.
- `scenes.py`, `cropdetect.py`, `sync.py`, `caption.py --transcribe` and the colour-level probe run their ffmpeg measurements under `--timeout` and report a decode failure as `kind: ffmpeg` instead of an empty result or a traceback; the transcribe temp directory is removed afterwards.
- `render.py` and `batch.py` forward `--timeout` and `--overwrite` to every stage, not only `--fast`/`--dry-run`.
- fix: failed check/render/batch/verify report status failed; analysis runs get --timeout; render/batch forward the shared flags (#174)

## 1.4.3

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.2._

- A failed ffmpeg run no longer costs the caller an output file that existed before the run. Such a file is now written through a hidden sibling temp file and replaced only on success; on failure the original is untouched and the temp removed. Previously the partial-output cleanup deleted it (any FFmpeg), and on FFmpeg 5.x ffmpeg itself truncated it to 0 bytes before a filter error, with or without `--overwrite`.
- `--timeout` is enforced under `--progress`: the deadline is checked on a clock, so a deadlocked ffmpeg that prints no progress lines is killed and reported as `kind: timeout` instead of being waited on forever.
- fix: a failed run never costs the caller an existing output; --timeout is enforced under --progress (#173)

## 1.4.2

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.1._

- `color.py --correct` no longer desaturates bt709-tagged sources: the RGB stages are wrapped in explicit, matching YUV<->RGB conversions instead of libavfilter's auto-inserted pair, which used bt709 one way and bt601 the other (#159).
- docs(pitfalls): a literal skip-ci marker in a PR body silences the squash merge (#171)
- fix(color): --correct no longer desaturates bt709-tagged sources (#167)

## 1.4.1

_Automated release: version and notes generated from pull requests merged since 1.4.0._

- Every tool takes `--timeout SECONDS` (default 1800, `FFMPEG_SKILL_TIMEOUT`): a single ffmpeg run past the limit is killed, its partial output removed, and the failure reported as `kind: timeout` (exit 124) instead of hanging the caller.
- Every tool takes `--overwrite`. An output path that already exists (and was not written by this run) now prints a warning; `FFMPEG_SKILL_NO_OVERWRITE=1` makes it a refusal today, and 2.0 will refuse by default.
- `audio.py --music` (with or without `--duck`/`--music-loop`) no longer shortens the video: the mixed track is padded/trimmed to the source duration and a video-keeping output never uses `-shortest` (#164).
- fix(audio): a music bed never shortens the video; pad the mix to the source duration (#165)
- ci(release): push the bump commit with RELEASE_PUSH_TOKEN so the main ruleset lets it through (#170)

**Accidental major.** 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 contain no user-facing or compatibility change over 0.16.15 -- they are three routine CI dependency bumps that a release-automation bug labelled `major` (see `references/process-pitfalls.md`, fixed in #145). They are left published because npm never lets a version number be reused; treat 1.0.x as 0.16.x under a different name.

## 0.16.12 — verify the fully-automated release pipeline end to end

No functional code changes. `.github/workflows/release.yml` was rewritten to
auto-create the git tag, GitHub Release, and npm publish on every push to
`main` that bumps `package.json`'s version, but the first real run of it
(for 0.16.11) never got an npm publish to succeed: the `NPM_TOKEN` secret
wasn't valid yet, and once the tag existed the workflow's own guard
prevented a clean re-attempt under the same version. This bump exists
solely to give the pipeline a fresh, untagged version to run against so
the whole chain — tag, GitHub Release, and npm publish — can be verified
working in one pass.

## 0.16.11 — fix a contract/reality mismatch on AAC, three batch.py/render.py reliability bugs, and a non-atomic installer

Continuing the same external audit report's architecture/data-integrity/reliability findings:

- `_contract.py` declared `encoder:aac` unconditionally `required` for `audio.py`,
  `loudness.py` and `join.py`, but all three pick their audio codec from the output
  extension via `audio_codec_for()` (falling back to AAC only when the extension
  isn't otherwise covered) -- so `doctor` reported these tools entirely unusable
  on an ffmpeg build without an AAC encoder, even though they can still produce
  e.g. a `.flac` output with no AAC involved at all. Moved to `optional` with a
  `when`, matching the pattern `cut.py`/`silence.py` already used; `join.py`'s
  `libx264` requirement was similarly conditioned on joining video inputs.
  `export.py`'s AAC `when` also named "any preset except gif", though `prores`
  (`pcm_s16le`) and `copy` (stream copy) don't use AAC either -- corrected.
- `batch.py`'s `--recipe` project mode (`{"project": "p.json", "clip_key": N}`)
  computed its cache key by hashing only that small outer dict, never the
  referenced project file's own content -- so editing `p.json` (an export preset
  swapped from `copy` to a real re-encode, captions text, anything) without
  touching the recipe file itself left the cache key unchanged, and the stale
  cached output was silently served for the new settings. Fixed by folding the
  referenced file's content into the key.
- `batch.py`'s cache file was written with a plain `write_text()`, not atomic --
  a process killed mid-write left a truncated file that the next run's
  `json.loads()` treats as corrupt and silently discards, losing every prior
  cache entry, not just the interrupted one. Fixed via a sibling temp file +
  `os.replace()`.
- `render.py`'s default work directory name came only from the output path (e.g.
  `final_work`), with no PID or timestamp -- two concurrent `render.py` runs
  targeting the same output (a `batch.py` "project" recipe processing several
  files in parallel, or simply two runs by mistake) shared the same work
  directory and clobbered each other's same-named intermediates mid-run. Fixed
  by suffixing the auto-derived default with this process's PID (an explicit
  `--work` is left as given, since the caller asked for that exact path).
- `bin/install.js` deleted an existing install (`rmSync`) before copying the new
  one in -- normal install, not just `--uninstall`. A process killed partway
  through the copy (Ctrl-C, disk full, a permission error) left the target
  either empty or half-populated, destroying a working previous install for
  nothing worse than an interrupted upgrade. Confirmed live: a simulated crash
  mid-copy left the target directory completely empty, an existing marker file
  gone. Fixed by copying into a scratch directory next to the real target first,
  then swapping it into place with a single rename.

## 0.16.10 — fix batch.py arbitrary script execution, and four fit/background/caption/freeze correctness bugs

- **Security:** `batch.py`'s recipe `steps` named the script to run for each
  step as a plain, untrusted string from `batch.json` (`run_step()` built
  `HERE / argv[0]`). `pathlib`'s `/` operator silently ignores the left side
  when the right side is itself an absolute path, and does nothing to stop a
  `../` traversal either -- so a `batch.json` the caller didn't author
  themselves (a template, a shared config, anything from outside) could name
  any Python file on disk (absolute path or `../` traversal) and have it
  executed with the caller's own privileges, once per matching media file.
  Confirmed with a live repro: a recipe step of `["/tmp/evil.py"]` executed
  and wrote a file outside the project. Fixed by validating each step's
  script name against the real, non-underscore-prefixed scripts in
  `scripts/` before running it.
- `fit.py` with only `--aspect` given (no `--width`/`--height`) bounded a
  narrower/taller target by the source's *width* instead of its height --
  a 1280x720 source asked for `--aspect 9:16` came out 1280x2276, a ~3.16x
  unrequested upscale, in both `--fit pad` and `--fit crop`. Fixed by
  bounding by whichever of the source's dimensions the new aspect actually
  needs, so the output never exceeds the source's own resolution.
- `background.py --gradient` used ffmpeg's `gradients` source filter without
  pinning its `speed` option, which defaults to `0.01` -- a slow rotation
  applied every frame. A "static" background (per this tool's own purpose:
  a title card, a placeholder behind a logo) silently drifted frame to
  frame instead of staying put, breaking the `bit_exact`/`deterministic`
  contract `_contract.py` declares for this tool. Confirmed live: the same
  pixel read a different value one second into a three-second clip. Fixed
  by pinning `speed` near the filter's own enforced floor (`1e-05`; `0`
  itself is refused) and `seed` to a fixed value.
- `caption.py`'s cue parser could match a line's `-->`/text structure while
  one of its two timestamps still failed to parse (e.g. a malformed
  `00:00:03.15.999`); the fallback then used the *entire raw line*,
  broken timestamp included, as the caption text instead of the text
  already captured after the arrow. Fixed to fall back to just the parsed
  text.
- `freeze.py`'s mid-clip freeze rounds the video hold to a whole number of
  frames (`n = round(hold * fps)`) but padded the audio by the raw,
  unrounded `--hold` value -- up to half a frame off from what the video
  actually holds for, a permanent A/V drift from that point on. Fixed by
  padding audio by the same frame-rounded duration the video gets.
- `cut.py` passed `--start`/`--end` straight to `parse_time()` with no sign
  check, unlike `freeze.py`/`background.py`, which already refuse negative
  durations -- a negative value reached ffmpeg's `-ss` as `-5.000000`
  instead of being refused with a clear error naming the flag. Fixed by
  refusing negative `--start`/`--end` up front.

## 0.16.9 — fix the MCP server crashing on a non-object JSON-RPC line

`mcp/server.py`'s stdio loop parsed each line with `json.loads()`, which
accepts any valid JSON value, not just an object -- a bare `42`, `null`,
`true` or `[1,2,3]` line parses without error. The very next check,
`"id" not in req`, then raised an uncaught `TypeError` for a non-dict
`req` (an int/bool/None isn't iterable the way `in` needs). That check
sat outside the `try/except` wrapping `handle()`, so the exception
propagated out of the stdin loop and killed the entire stdio server
process -- not just that one malformed line, but every other in-flight
and future tool call in the session along with it. Fixed by skipping any
parsed JSON value that isn't a dict before the `"id" not in req` check.

## 0.16.7 — fix a silently-dropped render.py fit height and a multicam.py drift-trim ordering bug

- `render.py`'s single-clip fit path only ever inherited `width`/`fps` from
  `project.frame` (never `height`), and the flag-forwarding list that turns
  `project.fit`'s own keys into `fit.py` argv had no entry for `height` at
  all. A `project.json` specifying `"fit": {"height": N}` alone built an
  empty `fit.py` argv and crashed with "nothing to do"; combined with
  another `fit` key (e.g. `duration`), `height` silently never reached
  `fit.py` and the output's height was left unchanged with no error. Fixed
  by adding the missing `frame.get("height")` inheritance and the
  `("height", "--height")` forwarding entry, matching the multi-clip `join`
  path, which already handled `height` correctly.
- `multicam.py --fix-drift` computed its audio trim start (`a_start`) in
  the source's own pre-correction time axis, but applied it via `atrim=
  start=` *after* the `asetrate`/`aresample` drift-correction filters had
  already rescaled that axis in the same filter chain -- so the trim
  landed on the wrong point once the timeline had been stretched or
  compressed by the drift ratio. `sync.py` already avoids this by seeking
  with `-ss` (an input-level operation) before its own drift filters;
  `multicam.py` now applies `atrim=start=`/`asetpts` before `asetrate`/
  `aresample` in the filter chain to match.

## 0.16.5 — fix silence.py breaking on audio-only WAV, unvalidated --fps, and a LUT-strength inversion in color.py

A deep line-by-line pass over the most-used editing tools:

- `silence.py` unconditionally appended `aac_args()` (`-c:a aac`) to its
  final ffmpeg command regardless of the output container. AAC cannot be
  muxed into a `.wav` file, so silence removal crashed outright on any
  audio-only WAV input or `-o out.wav` target -- a very ordinary case
  (podcasts, voice memos) the existing test suite happened to only cover
  with `.m4a` (where AAC is always valid, masking the bug). Fixed by
  picking the codec from the output extension via `audio_codec_for()`,
  the same helper every sibling script already uses, and by adding `-vn`
  when the output is audio-only but the input has video.
- `--fps` flowed straight into `cfr_args()` / a
  `fps or source_fps or 30.0` fallback in `crop.py`, `denoise.py`,
  `redact.py`, `sphere.py`, `straighten.py`, `join.py` and `multicam.py`
  without ever being validated. `0` is falsy in Python, so `--fps 0` was
  silently discarded and fell back to the source's own fps instead of
  erroring; a negative value passed straight through to ffmpeg's `-r`/
  `fps=` filter option, which rejects it with an unhelpful crash instead
  of a clear message naming `--fps`. Fixed by refusing `--fps <= 0` up
  front in all seven scripts, matching the guard `fit.py`/`proxy.py`/
  `background.py`/`grid.py`/`insert.py`/`sequence.py` already had.
- `color.py --lut-strength` (documented "blend LUT result with the
  original, 0..1") only branched into its blend logic for the *open*
  interval `(0, 1)` -- so `--lut-strength 0`, meant to mean "no LUT at
  all", instead fell into the "apply at full strength" fallback and
  silently graded the picture at 100%, the opposite of what was asked.
  Any out-of-range value (`2.5`, `-1`) did the same instead of being
  refused. Fixed by validating the range up front and handling `0`
  explicitly as "leave the picture untouched."
- `verify.py` built every file's output prefix from only its basename
  (`stem = outdir / f.stem`), so two files with the same name from
  different folders -- ordinary for real footage pulled from multiple
  cameras/SD cards -- resolved to the identical output prefix; with
  `--keep`, the file processed second silently overwrote the first one's
  finished output, with the report still showing PASS for both and no
  collision ever flagged. Same bug class as 0.16.4's `batch.py` fix.
  Fixed by disambiguating every colliding stem with a stable per-
  collision index before any file is processed.

## 0.16.4 — fix a silent false-PASS in check.py, an infinite loop in multicam.py, and a silent output collision in batch.py

Three unrelated bugs found in a wider audit past `caption.py`:

- `check.py`: `measure_loudness()` returns `{}` when ffmpeg's `loudnorm` JSON
  doesn't parse out of stderr (unexpected/garbled output). `main()` only
  appended the `loudness`/`true peak` rows when that measurement succeeded,
  so a failed measurement made those rows vanish entirely -- not FAIL, not
  WARN, just absent -- while `check.py` still reported an overall PASS for
  a platform with a loudness requirement it never actually verified. Fixed
  by reporting `WARN` (could not measure) instead of dropping the rows: a
  silent false PASS is worse than visible noise on a compliance tool.
- `multicam.py`: `--auto` alternates cameras with
  `while t < ref_dur: ... t += args.auto`, gated by `elif args.auto:` --
  which is only false for exactly `0`, so a negative value passed the
  check and entered the loop with `t` decreasing every iteration, hanging
  forever instead of erroring on invalid input. Fixed by refusing
  `--auto <= 0` up front.
- `batch.py`: a recipe's default output extension falls back to each
  source's own extension, so files that only differ by extension don't
  collide -- but a recipe with a fixed `"ext"` (e.g. converting a folder
  of mixed `.mp4`/`.mov` masters to one format) makes two sources with the
  same stem (`clip.mp4` and `clip.mov`) resolve to the identical final
  path (`clip_out.mp4`). `process()` had no collision detection, so the
  file processed later in sorted order silently overwrote the earlier
  one's finished output, with the cache still recording both entries as
  `"ok": true`. Fixed with a pre-flight collision check across the whole
  batch, refusing before any file is processed rather than after data is
  already lost.

## 0.16.3 — fix two more caption.py delimiter bugs: ASS override injection, SRT blank-line split

Following on from 0.16.2's `--font` fix, a closer look at `caption.py` found
two more places where user-controlled cue text (from `--text`, an SRT
file, or ASR transcription) flows raw into a delimited text format:

- ASS `Dialogue:` text treats a literal `{...}` as an override block --
  real style/animation commands (`\pos`, `\fscx`, `\t`, ...), not literal
  characters. Cue text containing braces was interpreted as those
  commands instead of read out, letting a caption reposition, rescale,
  or recolor itself or later text. Fixed by dropping `{`/`}` from cue
  text before writing the ASS `Dialogue:` line (also closes the same gap
  in the karaoke word-by-word path, which built its `{\kf..}` tags from
  the same unsanitised text).
- `write_srt()` wrote cue text raw. `parse_text_cues()` turns a bare `|`
  into a newline (the documented two-line-caption syntax), so two
  adjacent pipes (`a||b`) produced cue text containing a blank line --
  and a blank line is SRT's own block separator. Writing it raw split
  one cue into two malformed half-blocks, silently dropping the text
  after the fake boundary when re-parsed. Fixed by collapsing any run of
  blank lines within a cue's text to a single newline before writing.

## 0.16.2 — fix caption.py's --font not sanitised for ASS Style/force_style

An attack-surface audit of every call site that embeds user-controlled text
into a filter/subtitle construct found that `caption.py` was the one script
that never routed `--font` through a sanitiser before using it, unlike
`overlay.py`/`graphics.py`/`grid.py`/`look.py`, which all call
`escape_drawtext()` first. `caption.py` doesn't build a `drawtext=` filter,
though -- it embeds `--font` into two different ASS constructs
`escape_drawtext()` was never designed for: the comma-delimited
`[V4+ Styles]` `Style:` line, and the comma-separated `Key=Value` list
inside a `-vf subtitles=...:force_style='...'` option. A font name
containing a comma shifted every field after it in the `Style:` line
(size, colours, bold flag, alignment, margins); a comma or colon inside
`force_style`'s `FontName=` broke the option-list/`-vf` parsing the same
way.

Fixed with a new `ass_font_name()` helper in `caption.py` that drops
`, : \ '` and control characters from the font name outright -- the same
"no real font name needs this character, so don't chase a per-context
escape" call this codebase already made for `escape_drawtext()`'s `'`/`%`.

## 0.16.1 — fix two more escape_drawtext() gaps, and grid.py --pad's audio

Adversarial testing (deliberately hostile filenames -- very long, Unicode,
shell metacharacters, quotes, semicolons, `%` specifiers, literal filter-
graph syntax) found two more gaps in `escape_drawtext()`, the shared helper
every `drawtext=text=...` call site uses (`overlay.py --text`, the
`--font`/brand-font fallback, and 0.16.0's `grid.py` labels):

- An unescaped `;` split a filterchain exactly like an unescaped `,` does --
  minimal repro: `overlay.py clip.mp4 --text "a'b;c"` crashed real ffmpeg
  with `No such filter: 'c...'`. Fixed by adding `;` to the backslash-escape
  set.
- The quote character itself had no backslash escape that survives every
  call shape this codebase uses it in: both the existing `\'`-style escape
  and a POSIX-shell `'\''` close-insert-reopen escape parse fine in a
  simple `-vf` chain, but corrupt a `-filter_complex` chain with explicit
  `[label]` pads (grid.py's shape) -- confirmed by rendering the result:
  the text value doesn't end where the quote closes it, and trailing
  option text (`fontfile=...`, `fontsize=...`) leaks into the picture as
  literal burnt-in text. Fixed by dropping the quote character outright
  instead of escaping it -- losing one apostrophe from a label is a fair
  trade for the filter graph parsing correctly everywhere.
- `%` had the same problem the quote character did: the existing `\%`
  escape is not a real escape as far as drawtext's own text-expansion
  scanner (on by default, for `%{pts}`/`%{localtime}`/etc., a separate
  pass from the graph-level backslash escaping) is concerned -- a bare
  backslash-escaped `%` always logs "Stray % near ...", which is merely
  noisy on one ffmpeg build but a hard filtering failure that writes no
  output at all on another. No caller ever wants `%{...}` expansion, so
  `%` (and control characters, same underlying cause) are dropped outright
  instead of chasing a per-build-safe escape.

Also fixed a real bug CodeRabbit's review of 0.16.0 caught before it was
acted on: `grid.py --pad` held each shorter cell's video on its last frame
out to the longest clip, but a `--audio-from` track shorter than that was
mapped straight through with no padding at all -- the release note's "with
silence" claim wasn't true. Now `--pad` pads the selected audio track with
`apad`/`atrim` to match, and the docstring/help text describe what `--pad`
actually does (holds the last frame; does not add black video).

## 0.16.0 — add grid.py

New tool: composite `--cols`x`--rows` clips into one grid (e.g. a 4x2 wall
of takes or angles), each cell letterboxed (not stretched) to a common
`--cell-width`/`--cell-height` so mismatched aspect ratios and resolutions
line up cleanly. `--label auto` (default) burns each clip's own filename,
extension stripped, into its cell's bottom-right corner; `--label none`
turns that off. No audio unless `--audio-from` picks one input's track --
mixing every clip's audio together is rarely what a comparison grid needs,
so this tool never does it silently. Runs only as long as the shortest
clip by default; `--pad` instead holds each shorter clip's last frame (with
silence) out to the longest.

The per-cell label is filename-derived text reaching a `drawtext=text=...`
option, the same injection class fixed in 0.15.3 -- wrapped with the
existing `escape_drawtext()` helper from the start, with a regression test
that builds a clip literally named to look like a filter-graph breakout
payload and confirms it renders as inert literal text (not a new filter).

## 0.15.3 — fix a real filter-graph injection via --font fallback

Found by the same adversarial pass that produced 0.15.2, this time auditing
file-path/text escaping instead of colour flags. `overlay.py --font` and
`graphics.py`'s brand-font fallback both accept a fontconfig family NAME (not
a file path) and try to resolve it to a concrete file via `default_font_file()`
(`fc-match`) first -- but that resolution returns `None` whenever `fc-match`
isn't on `PATH` (true on some real systems, and always true on Windows, per
`default_font_file()`'s own docstring). When it returns `None`, both tools
fell back to `font='{args.font}'` with zero escaping, unlike the adjacent
`text='{escape_drawtext(args.text)}'` one line above it in `overlay.py`.
Since drawtext options are comma/colon-delimited, a font value like
`X',drawtext=text=OWNED` doesn't just fail to resolve a font -- the comma
ends the option (and the whole filter) early and starts an entirely new
drawtext filter, which actually rendered. Confirmed this is a real, working
injection (not theoretical): forced the `fc-match`-missing fallback path,
ran `overlay.py --font "X',drawtext=text=OWNED:fontcolor=yellow..."`, and the
injected "OWNED" text was actually burnt into the output picture.

Fixed by wrapping both fallback values with the existing `escape_drawtext()`
helper, matching the already-safe `text=` pattern next to it:

- `overlay.py`'s `font='{args.font}'` fallback (line ~250)
- `graphics.py`'s `font_opts()` fallback (`font='{font or brand.get(...)}'`)

## 0.15.2 — fix a real filter-graph injection via colour flags

Found by adversarial testing: every flag that string-formats a colour straight
into an ffmpeg filter graph accepted the value verbatim, with no validation.
Since ffmpeg filter options are comma/colon-delimited, a value like
`black,drawtext=text=INJECTED` doesn't just set an odd colour -- the comma
ends the colour filter early and starts an entirely new one. Confirmed this is
a real, working injection, not a theoretical one: rendered a frame with
`pad.py --color 'black,drawtext=text=INJECTED:fontcolor=white'` and the
injected text was actually burnt into the output picture.

Added `validate_color()` to `_common.py` (refuses anything that isn't a named
colour, `0xRRGGBB[AA]`, or `#RRGGBB[AA]`, optionally with an `@alpha` suffix)
and applied it to every colour-like flag that reaches a filter graph
unescaped:

- `pad.py --color`, `straighten.py --fill-color`, `waveform.py --background`
  and `--color` (new tools, this release cycle)
- `background.py --color`/`--gradient`, `fit.py --pad-color`,
  `export.py --pad-color`, `join.py --pad-color`, `overlay.py --chromakey`/
  `--font-color`/`--border-color`/`--box-color` (pre-existing tools -- this
  gap predates the recent tool additions)

`caption.py`'s colour flags were already safe (routed through the existing
`color_hex()`/`ass_color()` strict RRGGBB validators) and needed no change.

This is the same "no filter graph accepted from the caller" invariant every
other typed flag in this codebase already holds to -- colour flags were the
one place a free-form string still reached a filter graph unescaped. New
regression test proves the exploit across all 9 fixed call sites and that
real colour values still work; full suite (183 tests) and the contract suite
(67 tests) both pass.

## 0.15.1 — bug-check pass on the 39-tool set

Found and fixed while auditing the tools added across 0.13.0-0.15.0:

- `freeze.py`: `--at 0` (freeze on the very first frame -- the default when
  no `--mode`/`--at` is given at all combines with a source that starts
  right where you'd freeze it) crashed ffmpeg: the general insert-mode
  filter graph trims an empty "head" segment when `at == 0`, and filtering
  an empty stream fails. Added a dedicated `at == 0` branch that pads the
  front of the clip instead (`tpad` `start_mode=clone`), symmetric to
  `--mode extend`'s handling of the clip's end.
- `waveform.py`: `--audio-stream` was validated but never actually wired
  into the filter graph, which unconditionally read `[0:a]` -- every
  multi-track input visualized track 0 regardless of which track was
  requested, while the output's audio correctly followed `--audio-stream`.
  Now the filter reads `[0:a:{audio_stream}]`.
- `loop.py`: re-encoded with a hardcoded `libx264`/no `cfr_args`, unlike
  every other re-encoding tool -- an HDR source silently became SDR mislabelled
  BT.709, and VFR sources weren't conformed. Switched to `video_args(meta,
  ...)` and `cfr_args(meta)`, and added the `--crf`/`--preset` flags every
  other tool exposes (previously `--fast` silently had no effect).
- `_contract.py`: `cropdetect.py` always runs a real `cropdetect` measurement
  regardless of `--dry-run` (like `scenes.py`/`sync.py`/`multicam.py`/
  `report.py`), but wasn't declared in `DRY_RUN_ANALYSIS` -- the
  machine-readable contract falsely claimed `--dry-run` ran no ffmpeg for
  it. Registered alongside the other analysis-only tools.

Found via a fresh worktree off `main` post-merge, adversarial testing of
edge cases (zero/boundary values, multi-track inputs) rather than only the
happy paths the original PRs' tests covered. New regression tests for all
four; full suite (181 tests) and the contract suite (67 tests) both pass.

## 0.15.0 — 5 more tools: straighten, freeze, pad, speedramp, loop

Five more mechanical, typed-flag FFmpeg capabilities:

- `straighten.py` — rotates by an arbitrary angle for horizon correction
  (`rotate` filter), `--fit crop` (scale to fill, no visible gap) or `--fit
  pad` (keep the full picture, fill the corners). Distinct from `fit.py
  --rotate`'s exact 90-degree turns.
- `freeze.py` — holds a frame for N seconds (`tpad`/`concat`), `--mode
  insert` (pushes the rest of the clip later) or `--mode extend` (only at
  the clip's end, no push).
- `pad.py` — adds black/silent padding at the start and/or end of the
  timeline (`tpad`/`apad`). Distinct from `fit.py --fit pad`'s per-frame
  letterbox bars.
- `speedramp.py` — steps through different constant speeds across a clip
  via repeatable `--segment START-END:FACTOR` pieces (setpts/atempo per
  segment, concatenated). Distinct from `fit.py`'s single whole-clip speed
  factor.
- `loop.py` — repeats a clip `--times` N or to a target `--duration`
  (`-stream_loop`).

Same conventions as every other tool here: every numeric flag range-checked
before ffmpeg runs, no subject detection or judgement (straighten doesn't
measure the tilt, loop doesn't smooth the seam, freeze doesn't pick where
to hold -- the calling agent supplies all of that).

Registered in `_contract.py`'s `TOOL_META`/`REENCODE_META` (39 tools total,
up from 34); 19 new regression tests in `tests/test_all.py`, including a
pixel-level check that `straighten.py --fit crop` leaves no black corner.

## 0.14.0 — 5 new tools: cropdetect, deinterlace, denoise, redact, waveform

Five mechanical, typed-flag FFmpeg capabilities that had no wrapper yet:

- `cropdetect.py` — measures existing black letterbox/pillarbox bars (FFmpeg's
  `cropdetect` filter) and reports the `crop.py`-ready rectangle. Analysis only,
  writes no file. Distinct from `fit.py --fit crop`, which crops to a target
  aspect ratio it computes itself with no black-bar measurement involved.
- `deinterlace.py` — deinterlaces old interlaced source footage (`yadif`),
  `--mode frame` (keeps fps) or `--mode field` (doubles fps), `--parity`.
- `denoise.py` — video noise/grain reduction (`hqdn3d`), `--strength low/
  medium/high` or individual spatial/temporal luma/chroma overrides. Distinct
  from `audio.py --denoise`, which only touches audio.
- `redact.py` — blurs or pixelates an exact caller-given pixel rectangle for
  the whole clip (privacy/compliance redaction: faces, plates). Same
  rectangle convention as `crop.py`; does not locate anything itself.
- `waveform.py` — renders an audio track as a waveform or spectrum
  visualization video (`showwaves`/`showspectrum`), for audio-only inputs
  with no picture worth showing.

All five follow this skill's typed-flags-only convention: every numeric flag
is range-checked against FFmpeg's own real documented AVOptions before
ffmpeg runs, and none introduces any subject detection or judgement --
cropdetect measures existing bars, redact blurs the exact rectangle it's
given, neither decides what belongs in frame.

Registered in `_contract.py`'s `TOOL_META`/`REENCODE_META` (34 tools total,
up from 29); 22 new regression tests in `tests/test_all.py` cover the
functional path and validated ranges for each tool.

## 0.13.0 — add `sphere.py`: flat-viewport extraction from 360/spherical video

New tool wrapping FFmpeg's `v360` filter for the most common 360-video job: pointing a fixed,
typed camera (`--yaw`/`--pitch`/`--roll`, `--h-fov`/`--v-fov`) at an equirectangular (or
fisheye/cubemap/etc., via `--input-projection`) source and baking out an ordinary flat video.
Consistent with this skill's design boundary: it aims and extracts a viewport, it does not detect
or track a subject — that decision stays with the calling agent. Registered in `TOOL_META`/
`REENCODE_META`, 29 tools total.

## 0.12.6 — stop shipping `__pycache__` in the npm tarball

`package.json`'s `files` array scopes the tarball to `bin/`, `scripts/`, `mcp/`, `references/`,
`SKILL.md`, `README.md` and `LICENSE`, but a `files`-scoped pack does not automatically respect
`.gitignore` the way a plain `git`-tracked-files pack would — the 0.12.5 tarball on npm shipped
every `scripts/__pycache__/*.pyc` a local interpreter had produced (interpreter-version-specific,
harmless at runtime since Python regenerates them, but ~45% of the package's unpacked size for
nothing). Added an explicit `.npmignore` for `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, which npm honors
even when `files` is set. Unpacked size drops from 913.7 kB / 64 files to 496.8 kB / 40 files.

## 0.12.5 — fix Windows `drawtext` crash (#100), and 4 smaller review findings

`look.py`, `scenes.py --sheet`, `overlay.py --text` and `graphics.py` could crash on real Windows
FFmpeg builds (confirmed on winget's gyan.dev 9.x): `drawtext`'s own fontconfig resolution dies
with an access violation whenever it has to resolve a font by family name, with or without a
valid `fonts.conf` — and `doctor` reported `missing required: none`, since `-filters` correctly
lists `drawtext` as present; the crash only ever surfaced as a runtime failure, the exact thing
the step-0 capability check exists to prevent.

- All four tools now resolve a concrete font file by default (`default_font_file()` in
  `_common.py`: a well-known system font path on Windows, `fc-match` on Linux/macOS) and emit
  `fontfile=` instead of `font=` whenever one can be found — `fontfile=` skips fontconfig
  entirely, the one form confirmed not to crash. `font=` remains the fallback when nothing can be
  resolved, unchanged from before.
- `doctor` now actually renders one frame through `drawtext` instead of trusting the `-filters`
  listing alone. A confirmed crash (killed by signal on POSIX, an access-violation-style exit on
  Windows) downgrades `filter:drawtext` from "listed" to `missing`, with the crash detail in
  `errors[]`; an ordinary nonzero exit proves nothing either way and leaves the listing-based
  result standing (same "unknown is not missing" principle used everywhere else in capability
  detection).
- `scenes.py --sheet` gained `--no-timecode`, matching `look.py`, as a way out if drawtext is
  ever genuinely unusable on a machine.
- Fixed a `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\;'` in `_common.py`'s `shell_quote()` (a stray
  backslash before an already-unescaped character; harmless today, an error in a future Python).
- README's Quick Start script examples now note that Windows/Git Bash needs `python`, not
  `python3` (`bin/install.js` and `doctor`/`contract` already handled this; the raw examples
  didn't say so).
- SKILL.md's Gotchas section documents the crash and the fixes above.

## 0.12.4 — `stabilize.py` gains `--tripod` and `--crop` (#96)

A follow-on audit of the same class of gap 0.12.3 closed in `color.py --correct`: scripts that
wrap a real FFmpeg filter but only expose a subset of what that filter actually supports.
`stabilize.py` wrapped `vidstabdetect`/`vidstabtransform` with only `--shakiness`/`--smoothing`/
`--zoom`, leaving two genuinely useful, real options unreachable:

- `--tripod`: virtual tripod mode (`vidstabdetect`'s `tripod=1`, `vidstabtransform`'s own
  `tripod=1`, equivalent to `relative=0:smoothing=0`) locks every frame to one fixed reference
  frame instead of following the camera's intended motion — for a shot meant to be static but
  nudged, or one you want dead-locked rather than merely smoothed.
- `--crop {keep,black}`: what happens to whatever edge `--zoom` doesn't crop away.
  `vidstabtransform`'s `crop=0` (the previously hardcoded default, "keep") stretches border
  pixels; `crop=1` ("black") was unreachable — the only prior workaround was cropping in further
  with `--zoom`, at the cost of framing/resolution.

Both are typed flags (`--crop` restricted to the filter's own two real option names via
`choices`), verified against `ffmpeg -h filter=vidstabdetect`/`vidstabtransform`'s real AVOptions
before implementation, with new regression tests that actually run both flags end-to-end and
check the output's duration/resolution. (`silence.py`, `audio.py`, `loudness.py`, and `fit.py`'s
`minterpolate` usage were also checked against their real filters' full option sets and found
either not applicable — `silence.py` doesn't wrap `silenceremove` at all, it does its own
`silencedetect` + range-trim — or already adequately covered.)

## 0.12.3 — `color.py --correct` gains gamma, lift/gain, levels and curves

Closes a long-standing, documented gap: the downstream `color-grading-skill` has carried
`GAMMA`/`LIFT`/`GAIN`/`LEVELS`/`CURVES` in its own `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATIONS` because
"ffmpeg-skill exposes no typed X filter in its public contract". `--correct` gains five more
typed flags, all folded into the same fixed filter chain the existing `--exposure`/`--contrast`/
`--saturation`/`--temperature`/`--tint` already build — no new mode, no filter string ever
accepted from the caller:

- **`--gamma`** (0.1..10, default 1=unchanged): `eq`'s own `gamma` option, added to the same
  `eq=contrast=...:saturation=...` term contrast/saturation already use, not a second `eq` call.
- **`--lift` / `--gain`** (-1..1 each, default 0=unchanged): classic three-way colour correction,
  extending the same `colorbalance` call `--tint` already used for midtones — `--lift` sets the
  shadow channels (`rs=gs=bs`), `--gain` the highlight channels (`rh=gh=bh`), the same
  all-three-channels-together convention `--tint` uses for `rm/gm/bm`. Confirmed against
  `ffmpeg -h filter=colorbalance`: `rs/gs/bs`, `rm/gm/bm`, `rh/gh/bh`, each documented -1..1.
- **`--levels-in-black` / `--levels-in-white` / `--levels-out-black` / `--levels-out-white`**
  (0..255 each, defaults 0/255/0/255=unchanged; rejects `in_black >= in_white` or
  `out_black >= out_white` before ffmpeg runs): `colorlevels`, whose real parameters
  (`ffmpeg -h filter=colorlevels`) take fractional 0.0..1.0 input/output black/white points, not
  0..255 — this tool exposes the familiar 8-bit unit and divides by 255.0 when building the
  filter, the same "human unit in, filter's native unit out" convention `--temperature` already
  uses. The `colorlevels=` term is only added to the chain when at least one of the four flags is
  given; an all-default `--correct` call adds no `colorlevels` term, matching how every stage in
  this chain is either always present at its own no-op default or (for this new pair) omitted
  entirely when unused.
- **`--curves PRESET`** (argparse `choices`, default: none, no `curves=` term added): the `curves`
  filter's own built-in presets, read from `ffmpeg -h filter=curves` rather than assumed:
  `color_negative`, `cross_process`, `darker`, `increase_contrast`, `lighter`,
  `linear_contrast`, `medium_contrast`, `negative`, `strong_contrast`, `vintage` (the filter's own
  11th choice, `none`, is omitted from `--curves`'s choices since leaving the flag unset already
  gets that identity result without adding a filter term for it).
- Contract: `color`'s optional capabilities gain `filter:colorlevels` (`when: "--correct with any
  --levels-*"`) and `filter:curves` (`when: "--correct --curves"`). No change to any existing flag,
  contract field, MCP schema or tool semantics.
- Tests: 5 real-media tests in `tests/test_all.py` mirroring the existing `--correct` style —
  gamma/lift/gain run and measurably change signalstats luma, levels narrows the measured dynamic
  range, curves runs and preserves geometry/duration, and out-of-range or inverted values for
  every new flag (`--gamma`, `--lift`, `--gain`, `--levels-in-black`/`--levels-in-white` inverted,
  `--levels-out-black`/`--levels-out-white` inverted, an invalid `--curves` choice) are each
  refused before ffmpeg ever runs, with no partial output.

## 0.12.2 — `caption.py --mode mux` no longer drops the input's existing subtitle track(s)

Found while discussing a real use case (adding both an English and a Japanese soft subtitle
track to a foreign video) and reproduced directly: chaining `--mode mux` once per language —
the natural way to build a multi-language subtitle set — silently dropped every earlier
language but the last, because the mode's `-map` list never included the main input's own
existing subtitle stream(s), only the freshly-added one. Same class of bug fixed across
`fit.py`/`color.py`/`graphics.py`/`overlay.py` in 0.12.1/#91 (deliberately scoped out of that
pass since burn mode raises a real design question mux mode doesn't have: mux mode explicitly
promises "copies video/audio untouched, adds the SRT as a soft, toggleable subtitle stream", so
keeping what was already there has one obvious answer). Existing tracks are now mapped and
stream-copied (`-c:s:i copy` per existing index) ahead of the new one, whose own `-c:s`/
`-metadata:s:s:N` now target its real index instead of always `0`. Closes
[#93](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/93).

## 0.12.1 — Stream-preservation audit: subtitle/data streams no longer silently dropped by picture-only edits

Prompted by an external review pushing back that "feature-complete" for this project now means
proving reliability, not adding tools. Audited all 28 tools against a real fixture carrying
video + audio + subtitle + chapters, by actually running each tool and `ffprobe`-ing its output
rather than reading the code and guessing (an ad hoc pass, not itself checked in as a test). The
checked-in regression test below covers the four tools this pass actually changed, against a
narrower existing fixture (video + audio + two subtitle tracks, no chapters).

- **`fit.py`, `color.py` (`--correct`/`--lut`/`--to-sdr`), `graphics.py`, `overlay.py`: kept the
  source's subtitle/data streams instead of silently dropping them.** Each of these builds an
  explicit `-map` list naming only the video and audio streams it re-encodes; a source with an
  embedded subtitle track (or a data stream) lost it with no signal to the caller, even though
  the operation never touched it. `chapters` already survived regardless (`-map_chapters`
  defaults independently of `-map`) — this was specifically about subtitle/data. Each of the four
  now tries `-map 0:s? -map 0:d? -c:s copy -c:d copy` alongside its existing maps first (a no-op
  via `?` when the source has none), falling back to the original video+audio-only command only
  if that combined attempt fails (e.g. a subtitle codec that can't be stream-copied into a
  changed output container) — the same fallback shape `color.py --retag` already used for this
  in 0.12.0. `--json` gains `dropped_non_av_streams` (`true` only when that fallback was actually
  needed), matching the field name `--retag` already introduced.
- **Deliberately left as-is, tracked in [#91](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/91):**
  `caption.py`'s burn mode (whether a pre-existing embedded subtitle should coexist with a newly
  *burned-in* one is a real design question, not a clear-cut preservation fix); `audio.py` when
  its output is a video container; `join.py`/`multicam.py`/`sync.py`, which combine multiple
  separate input files or replace the audio track outright — "which input's subtitle survives"
  has no single correct answer the way a single-input picture/colour edit does, matching the
  existing "different problem shape" carve-out already used for the 0.12.0 `--audio-stream`
  extension. Attachments (`-map 0:t?`, e.g. embedded ASS fonts) are also not covered yet — no
  tool here currently reads/writes ASS-with-fonts end to end, so the risk is theoretical for now.
- Test: `test_picture_only_edits_keep_the_sources_subtitle_streams` runs all four fixed tools
  against `c_subbed.mkv` (two real embedded SRT tracks, already used by other tests) and asserts
  BOTH subtitle tracks survive and `dropped_non_av_streams` is `false`.
- **Two real regressions caught in code review before this shipped, both fixed and covered by a
  new test:** `overlay.py`'s `--image`/`--video` branches combined the pre-existing `-shortest`
  with the new subtitle map -- a subtitle ending before the main video could truncate the WHOLE
  output to the subtitle's length (reproduced: 6s video, 1s subtitle -> 1.04s output). `-shortest`
  is now used only when the source's duration is unknown; the existing `-t <duration>` (already
  there for FFmpeg 7+ precision) is used alone whenever it's known, since it only bounds the main
  input. Separately, `fit.py --method speed` retimes video/audio (`setpts`/`atempo`) but a
  stream-copied subtitle keeps its original timestamps, so it would silently desync from the
  now-faster/slower picture; `fit.py` now skips subtitle preservation specifically when changing
  speed and reports `dropped_non_av_streams: true` honestly instead. `probe()` gains an additive
  `data_streams` count (alongside the existing `subtitle_streams`) so that determination also
  catches a data-only stream with no subtitle track.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-09-07 — Hardening pass: stream/input safety, contract-vs-implementation drift, SKILL.md/eval consistency

A hardening-focused release: no new tools, no new features. Everything here closes a gap between
what the contract/docs/evals claimed and what the implementation actually did, or fixes a real
runtime defect found by reproducing it first. `contract_version` is unchanged — every contract
field addition here is additive.

- **Safety: a tool could be made to overwrite its own input via a same-file-different-string
  output path.** `-o ./same.mp4` against an input opened as `same.mp4` (or any relative/absolute
  pair, `..` segment, or symlink) resolves to the same file but passed ffmpeg's own
  byte-identical-string "Output same as Input" guard — `-y` then silently clobbered the source
  mid-encode. Reproduced on `crop.py` before the fix. `_check_no_overwrite_input()` in
  `_common.py`'s `run()` compares `os.path.realpath()` of every `-i` argument against the output
  path and refuses before ffmpeg starts, covering every writing tool from one choke point.
- **Safety: a failed `run()` call could leave a partial (often 0-byte) output file behind.**
  `verify_output()`'s cleanup only ran on the success path; a failure after ffmpeg had already
  opened the output (muxer header written, then a mid-stream error) left a stray file a caller
  could mistake for a real artifact. `_cleanup_partial_output()` now runs for every nonzero
  ffmpeg exit, `check=True` or `check=False`.
- **`color.py --retag`'s re-encode fallback used to silently drop every stream beyond
  video+audio-0.** The stream-copy path (`-map 0 -c copy`) keeps every stream — extra audio
  tracks, subtitles, chapters; the re-encode fallback (triggered when the copy fails) dropped all
  of them with no signal in `--json`. Added a middle tier that tries to keep subtitle/data
  streams via `-c:s`/`-c:d copy` alongside the required video/audio re-encode, and `--json` now
  reports `reencoded`/`dropped_non_av_streams` honestly instead of a bare `"completed"`.
- **`sync.py`'s `REENCODE_META` claimed `video="never"`; `--trim-second` actually re-encodes
  video** whenever the second recording starts later than the reference (the common case,
  `offset>=0`) or `--fix-drift` is used — only the `offset<0` stream-copy path leaves video
  untouched. Fixed to `"conditional"`/`"conditional"` with a note.
- **Error taxonomy (additive): `error.code` and `error.retryable`** now sit alongside every
  failure's existing `error.kind`/`error.message` — `code` is a static relabelling of the same 4
  kinds this codebase has always used (`INPUT_INVALID`/`DEPENDENCY_MISSING`/
  `FFMPEG_EXECUTION_FAILED`/`OUTPUT_INVALID`, `INTERNAL_ERROR` fallback), not a new taxonomy the
  code can't back up; `retryable` is currently always `false` (no kind is distinguishable from a
  deterministic failure without exit-code/stderr sniffing this codebase doesn't do). `kind`'s
  existing values and the rest of the JSON shape are unchanged.
- **`loudness.py --json` now includes the second-pass (post-normalization) measurement** as a
  `result` field — it was computed but only ever printed to stderr, so a caller had to make a
  separate `--measure-only` call to learn what loudness was actually achieved.
- **`--audio-stream N` extended to `overlay.py`, `graphics.py`, `color.py`; `fit.py` gained
  explicit audio mapping.** Every tool that re-encodes audio from a multi-track input now behaves
  consistently instead of silently defaulting to track 0 (or, for `fit.py`, to ffmpeg's own
  implicit "best stream" heuristic, which for audio favours channel count over track order).
  `join.py`/`multicam.py` are out of scope — they combine separate input files, a different
  problem shape. Closes [#62](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/62) (the same gap
  `caption.py`/`audio.py` already closed in [#55](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/55)).
- **`doctor --json` gains a `fonts` field**, informational like `gpu_encoders`: drawtext's default
  font (`caption.py --animate`/`--karaoke`, `graphics.py`) can silently substitute a different
  family when the requested one isn't installed — a drawtext exit code can't detect this
  (fontconfig substitutes for any name, valid or not), so `fc-match` is queried directly.
  Never gates `ok`/`usable`; a substituted font doesn't make the tool unusable, just possibly
  styled differently than intended.
- **`probe.py` gains `subtitle_stream_details`**, a detailed per-subtitle-stream array
  (`index`/`codec`/`language`/`title`) mirroring `audio_streams`' shape — `subtitle_streams`'
  existing int-count type and meaning are unchanged.
- **Doc-vs-implementation drift fixes**, each with a regression test pinning the doc text against
  the live code so the same drift can't recur silently:
  - `docs/contract.md`'s hand-copied `skill.version` example had drifted to a stale `0.9.1`
    while `package.json` had moved to `0.11.0`.
  - `docs/contract.md`'s failure-JSON example was missing the `code`/`retryable` fields above.
  - `SKILL.md`/`references/scripts.md` claimed unconditionally that every script's `--dry-run`
    runs nothing; `sync`/`multicam`/`scenes`/`report` genuinely run ffmpeg/ffprobe to measure or
    analyse under `--dry-run` (they just don't write the final artifact), and `verify` accepts
    the flag but ignores it — all three doc locations now name the real exception set.
  - `SKILL.md`'s Workflow section never mentioned `doctor`/`contract` at all, so an agent on an
    unfamiliar machine had no documented step to check capability before running a tool that
    depends on an optional filter/encoder. Added a step 0.
  - `SKILL.md`'s "Look at the picture" step told the agent to judge subject framing and
    text-over-faces as part of its own job, directly contradicting "What this skill does and does
    not decide"'s statement that this belongs to the calling agent. Split into a mechanical tier
    this skill verifies directly and a judgement tier reported to the calling agent — explicitly
    *not* flagging `fit.py --fit pad`'s letterboxing as a defect, since that's that mode's correct
    output. Also formalized `Look: PATH (pixels not inspected; agent has no image view)` for an
    execution environment that can't actually view images.
  - `bin/install.js`'s `contract`/`doctor` subcommand hardcoded `python3`; Windows Python
    installers commonly expose `python`/`py` instead (only the Microsoft Store package ships
    `python3`) — now falls back through `python3` → `python` → `py` on Windows. The same
    hardcoding was also present, unfixed by that change, in `mcp/server.py`'s and README's MCP
    client config examples — both now note the Windows alternative.
  - `evals/agent_prompts_exec.json`'s `f05-unsupported` claimed "no reverse tool in the skill"
    and scored refusing a reverse request as correct — `reverse.py` has existed the whole time
    and `SKILL.md`'s own routing table names it. It also endorsed a hand-written raw-ffmpeg
    fallback as acceptable, contradicting this project's own "never fall back to raw ffmpeg"
    policy stated elsewhere. Replaced with a genuinely unsupported case and a normal `reverse.py`
    success case; `evals/results/exec-1.json`'s historical record is left unedited with a note
    explaining the old grading was wrong.
- **Cross-platform: end-to-end non-ASCII filename coverage.** Filter-graph *string* escaping for
  Unicode paths was already tested; nothing exercised a non-ASCII filename as the actual `-i`/
  output argument through `subprocess` argv. Added a test copying a fixture to a CJK/accented
  filename and running `probe`/`cut` against it both directions — passes on all 3 CI platforms.
- **Docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`**, a `.github/workflows/release.yml` that automates GitHub Release
  creation once a version tag is pushed (tag creation itself stays a manual, deliberate act), and
  a one-line honest note that GPU-accelerated encoding stays off the roadmap without a
  real-hardware-verified design (build-presence detection, which `gpu_encoders` already limits
  itself to, is not proof a job succeeds).
- **`--dry-run`'s probe stub no longer fabricates plausible-looking `1920x1080`/`30fps` dimensions
  for a not-yet-written output.** A first attempt at this (reporting the honest `0`/`0.0` "not
  measured" value instead, matching `duration`/`size_bytes`'s existing convention in the same
  stub) had to be reverted mid-pass: `join.py` and `fit.py` both divide by a probed source
  width/height when computing the other dimension from an aspect ratio, and dry-run probes chain
  across multi-stage pipelines (a prior stage's still-unwritten dry-run output gets probed as the
  next stage's input), so a zero source dimension reached those divisions and crashed with
  `ZeroDivisionError`. Root-cause fixed instead: both division sites now treat a zero/unknown
  source dimension as "can't compute a ratio" and fall back to the requested dimension rather than
  dividing by it; every other tool touching probed width/height for aspect-ratio math was audited
  and either doesn't divide by it or hands it straight to an ffmpeg filter (moot under `--dry-run`,
  since ffmpeg never runs). `--json` was never affected by any of this — it always omitted the
  placeholder; only a dry-run's human-readable summary line could echo the fake number. Closes
  [#77](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/77).

- **`probe.py`: `subtitle_stream_details`.** `subtitle_streams` was a plain integer count while `audio_streams` was already a detailed array, so nothing could tell which subtitle index was which language on a multi-track input (e.g. an MKV with Japanese and English subs already muxed in). `subtitle_stream_details` adds that detail as a new, purely additive array — `[{"index", "codec", "language", "title"}, ...]`, one entry per embedded subtitle stream in file order (index n is `-map 0:s:n`), mirroring `audio_streams`' shape minus the audio-only fields (channels, layout, sample rate) ffprobe doesn't expose for subtitle streams. `subtitle_streams`' existing type and meaning (the int count) are unchanged. No writing tool selects among existing embedded subtitle streams yet; this is a `probe.py`-only enrichment. Closes [#63](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/63).
- **`caption.py --audio-stream N`: explicit multi-audio-track selection.** Confirmed `caption.py` did silently pick a track on a multi-audio-track input (dubbed languages, M&E stems): burn mode had no `-map` at all (ffmpeg's own automatic stream-selection heuristic, not necessarily index 0, decided), mux mode and the karaoke energy-timing/`--transcribe` audio extraction both hardcoded `0:a:0`. `--audio-stream N` (default 0, matching `audio.py`'s existing flag and unchanged prior behaviour) now threads the same explicit track index through all four: burn's re-encoded audio, mux's stream-copied audio, `--transcribe`'s speech-to-text source, and karaoke's energy-timing analysis, refusing an out-of-range index the same way `audio.py --audio-stream` already does. Closes [#55](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/55).
- **`caption.py --text`: SMPTE non-drop-frame timecode cues.** Cues were positioned by decimal seconds only; broadcast-style deliverables often supply cue timing as `hh:mm:ss:ff` frame timecode instead. `--text` cue lines now also accept that format (e.g. `00:00:03:15 --> 00:00:06:00 ...`) — the frame count is converted to seconds with `--fps`, or the input video's own probed fps when `--input` is given and `--fps` is not. A cue that is shaped like a timecode but has no fps available (no `--fps`, no `--input`) is refused with a clear error naming the missing `--fps`, rather than silently misread as a plain text line the way an ordinary unparseable cue line already is. `_common.py` gains the reusable pieces other tools can build on later: `parse_time()` takes an optional `fps` argument for the `hh:mm:ss:ff` case (raising the new `MissingFpsError`, a `ValueError` subclass, when fps is needed but absent), and `fmt_smpte_time()` formats seconds back to `hh:mm:ss:ff` — used here to echo the interpreted cue range in the `wrote ... .srt` report line so a caller can confirm the timecode was read correctly. The written `.srt` itself stays decimal-millisecond SRT timing, since that is the only timing SRT/mux subtitle codecs actually carry; nothing claims frame-exact precision it can't hold. Drop-frame (29.97/59.94 fps) counting is out of scope. Closes [#54](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/54).
- **`references/process-pitfalls.md`: development-process mistakes already made once.** Distinct from `references/ci-platform-pitfalls.md` (ffmpeg/CI behaviour differences): this is about the process of making a change safely, not FFmpeg itself. Three entries to start: narrowing a `TOOL_META[...]["required"]` capability list without first grepping `tests/test_contract.py`'s `DoctorDetectionTests` for the fixture-pinned `usable` outcome it protects (nearly broken twice, in #51 and #52, caught before landing both times); retrying a git tag push or GitHub Release creation in this environment, where both are scoped out (branch pushes work, tag pushes 403 at the git-receive-pack level; no `create_release`/`create_tag` MCP tool exists; the outbound proxy itself blocks a raw REST API call to the releases endpoint) rather than accepting it after one confirmation; and redesigning a test fixture a third time instead of recognising, after two independently-redesigned fixtures failed differently on the same platform, that the platform's real behaviour (not the fixture) is the actual cause (`stabilize.py`'s macOS libvidstab test). A living document — add to it whenever one of these recurs. Docs-only; no behaviour changed.
- **`doctor --json`: `gpu_encoders`.** No tool here uses GPU-accelerated encoding — every tool assumes CPU x264/x265 — but `doctor` had no way to answer "is GPU encoding available on this machine" at all, unlike every other capability it already reports `yes`/`no`/`unknown` for. `gpu_encoders` reports GPU-backed encoders (`nvenc`, `videotoolbox`, `qsv`, `vaapi`, `amf`) present in this ffmpeg *build*, read from the same `-encoders` listing `doctor` already parses — `{"status": "parsed"|"unparsed"|"failed"|"missing", "present": [...]}`. Deliberately build-presence only: proving a real GPU/driver will accept a job would need an actual encode, which `doctor`'s introspection never runs (matching its existing 10s-timeout, listing-only philosophy). Purely informational — no tool declares or requires a GPU encoder, so this field never affects `ok` or any tool's `usable`. The human-readable `doctor` output gets one line naming what's present (or "none"). Closes [#52](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/52).
- **`caption.py --mode mux`: soft subtitle stream instead of burn-in.** Every caption call previously re-encoded both streams to render pixels (`reencodes_video`/`reencodes_audio`: `"always"`) even when the caller only wanted a subtitle track added, not the picture changed. `--mode mux` (new; `--mode burn` stays the default) copies video and audio untouched (`-c:v copy -c:a copy`) and adds the SRT as a separate, player-toggleable subtitle stream — `reencodes_video`/`reencodes_audio` are now `"conditional"` with a note explaining the split. Only takes a plain SRT (`--srt`/`--text`/`--transcribe`), not `--ass`, `--animate` or `--karaoke`: styling and animation render pixels, so they have no soft-subtitle equivalent and are refused with a pointer to `--mode burn`. The subtitle codec is picked from the output container (`mov_text` for `.mp4`/`.m4v`/`.mov`, `srt` for `.mkv`, `webvtt` for `.webm`); an unrecognized container is refused rather than guessed at. `contract --json` gains three new optional capabilities (`encoder:mov_text`/`encoder:webvtt`/`encoder:srt`, each `"when"`-gated to the matching output container) so `doctor` can report them honestly; the existing required capabilities (`encoder:libx264`, `encoder:aac`, `filter:subtitles`) are unchanged, since `--mode burn` is still the default and doctor's usability model doesn't vary by flag. Closes [#51](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/51) — timecode-aware cue timing and explicit multi-audio-track selection were split out to [#54](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/54) and [#55](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/55) to keep this change reviewable.
- **Test: the prose tool count in README/`docs/contract.md`/`package.json` is now checked against the real tool list.** 0.11.0 was cut to fix exactly this drift (README said 28 twice and 22 once; `package.json` said 21) by hand, with nothing to stop it recurring. `tests/test_contract.py`'s `test_docs_tool_count_matches_the_real_tool_list` scans all three for `"<N> tools"` wording and fails if any number doesn't match `scripts/`'s actual public-tool count, so the next tool added/removed without updating every mention fails CI instead of drifting silently. `contract_version`/`skill.version` were already split (0.9.0) and already documented as "additive keeps `contract_version`, breaking bumps it" — `docs/contract.md` now also repeats the tagged-version pin guidance next to that table, since `capability_map` makes this the most cross-repo-facing part of the contract. Closes [#50](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/50).
- **Tests: `overlay.py --image` on an audio-less video is now covered.** Every existing overlay test used a
  source with audio; investigating a downstream report of `overlay.py` "hanging" on audio-less input (the
  historical 0.9.x defect this tool's own `-t <duration>` fix, added in 0.10.0, was meant to close) found the
  fix already works — the run had just been mistaken for a hang under a too-short timeout while it was still
  transcoding a 1080p60 frame with a fade filter. No code change; `test_overlay_on_audio_less_video_terminates`
  closes the coverage gap so this defect class can't silently regress.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-09-07 — Pixel crop, still-to-clip, rotate/flip/PiP/reverse/chromakey/stabilize/sequence/Ken Burns, fail-loudly output verification, capability map

Closes the video-editing-skill ADR-002/ADR-003 gap investigation (11 confirmed gaps): `crop.py`, `insert.py` (incl. Ken Burns), `fit.py --rotate`/`--flip`, `overlay.py --video`/`--chromakey` (video-on-video PiP, chroma key), `reverse.py`, `stabilize.py`, `sequence.py`, `background.py`, `proxy.py`, `contract --json`'s `capability_map`, and a repo-wide "fail loudly" pass making `verify_output()` the single success criterion for every writing tool. 28 tools total (was 21 at 0.10.0); README/package.json's stale "21"/"22" tool-count strings are also corrected to the real count here — see [#50](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/50) for making that count self-maintaining going forward.

- **SKILL.md: two more worked examples of the mechanical-vs-judgement line.** "What this skill does and does not decide" already named categories (which cut is right, highlight ranking, thumbnails, content understanding) but not the line itself. Adds "apply this LUT" (mechanical, in scope) vs. "grade this scene to look cinematic" (judgement, belongs to a colour-grading skill) and "crop to this exact box" vs. "crop to keep the speaker in frame" (needs a subject decision this skill doesn't make), plus one sentence stating the general rule: same input + same explicit parameters -> same verifiable output stays here; anything depending on taste or understanding goes to whichever skill or agent makes that call. Docs-only; no behaviour changed. Closes [#53](https://github.com/kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill/issues/53).
- **`references/ci-platform-pitfalls.md`: known per-OS ffmpeg/CI behaviour differences.** Several fixes in this repo exist only because of platform-specific, empirically observed behaviour (Windows Chocolatey ffmpeg lacking `-pattern_type glob` support, the concat demuxer's end-of-list duration trick over-counting by a frame, `#!/bin/sh` PATH shims not being portable to Windows, Windows reporting a crashed ffmpeg subprocess's exit code differently from what this repo captured, and macOS's libvidstab build disagreeing with Linux's on whether a shake fixture got better or worse) — each was independently diagnosed once, at the cost of a full CI cycle and log-reading. Writing them down means the next platform-only test failure gets checked against this list before spending another cycle re-diagnosing it. Docs-only; no behaviour changed.
- **`proxy.py`: low-bitrate proxy for downstream AI analysis, preview and editing decisions.** No tool here served a "cheap for a machine to decode" output distinct from `export.py`'s delivery presets, which all target near-visually-lossless platform delivery (CRF 18-24) rather than size/speed. `proxy.py` resizes to `--width` (default 640) or by `--scale` factor, re-encodes at a proxy-grade `--crf` (default 30) with the fastest x264/x265 preset, supports `--fps` and `--no-audio`, and keeps the source's own dynamic range (an HDR source proxies to HEVC10, same as every other re-encoding tool here — run `color.py --to-sdr` first if SDR is wanted). Pure mechanical resize+re-encode, same primitives `fit.py`/`export.py` already use: no new dependency, no GPU requirement, works identically regardless of source resolution (1080p/4K/6K/8K) or codec (H.264/H.265/ProRes, since ffmpeg's own decoders are already codec-agnostic everywhere in this repo). This tool only executes the spec it is given — it does not decide which asset should be proxied or what the proxy will be used for; that stays with the calling agent. `capability_map` gains `media.proxy` -> `proxy` (see below). Tests cover default width/CRF, `--scale`/`--no-audio`, forcing CFR on a VFR source, HDR passthrough, and dry-run.
- **`contract --json`: `capability_map`.** `provides` re-indexes each tool by an id shaped like its own name (`ffmpeg-skill.cut`); it doesn't let a planner that only knows an abstract goal ("I need to trim a video") find the right tool. `capability_map` is a new, small, hand-authored table: `[{"capability": "<domain>.<verb>", "tool_id": "ffmpeg-skill/<tool>", "params": {...}}, ...]`, covering `video.trim`, `video.reframe` (pins `fit` to `fit=crop`, since `fit.py` also duration-fits and pads), `audio.loudness`, `subtitle.burn`, `media.stream.inspect`, `media.frames.extract` and `media.proxy`. It is purely descriptive — a caller still builds and runs the named tool's own CLI/MCP call from its `input_schema`; this skill never picks a capability or executes on the caller's behalf. Deliberately excludes anything that would require judgment to resolve (no `video.highlight`, since `scenes.py --highlights` ranks by a measured proxy, not understood content). `docs/contract.md` documents the table and why it stays short; `tests/test_contract.py` verifies every entry resolves to a real tool and real params. Additive; no existing field changed.
- **`doctor`: this installed copy's own `version`.** `doctor --json` and the human-readable `doctor` now report the version of the copy answering, read locally from its own `package.json` (same value `contract --json`'s `skill.version` reports) — never fetched from the network, never compared against the latest published release. A copy installed with `npx ffmpeg-skill` is not updated automatically; the human-readable output and the installer `--help`/README Quick start now say to re-run the installer to refresh it. Additive; every existing `doctor` key is unchanged.
- **`doctor`: `ok` vs. per-tool `usable` clarified.** The human-readable `doctor` output now adds one line when `ok` is true but at least one tool's `usable` isn't `"yes"` (e.g. a plain Homebrew `ffmpeg` on macOS: overall `ok` since nothing required by *every* tool is missing, while `caption.py` specifically can't run). README Quick start says the same. No field changed, no behaviour changed — a caller reading `doctor` no longer has to already know to check `tools` separately from `ok`.
- **`doctor`'s Windows fix hint for a missing subtitles/drawtext/zscale filter** now names the same remedy README documents for that platform (`winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`, since the gyan.dev full build carries them and a plain choco package can lack them) instead of falling through to a generic "install/build it" message — matching the existing macOS `brew install ffmpeg-full` hint. No change on any other platform.
- **`doctor`'s own introspection calls get a 10s timeout.** `ffmpeg -filters`/`-encoders`/`-bsfs`/`-version` are meant to be fast, bounded, non-media operations; a hang here would silently freeze the one tool meant to report whether the machine is broken. They now time out and report `failed` rather than blocking forever. Deliberately NOT applied to any tool's actual media-processing ffmpeg invocation (cut, fit, caption, ...): a legitimate long re-encode must not be killed by an arbitrary ceiling. `-nostdin` was already passed everywhere (0.9.0), so a hang waiting on stdin was not possible; this closes the other silent-hang path. See README, "Requirements", for what remains the caller's own responsibility.
- **`tests/test_contract.py` now runs on Windows CI.** Only two spots (`test_dry_run_never_runs_ffmpeg_and_writes_nothing` and the whole `DoctorDetectionTests` class) actually depend on a POSIX `#!/bin/sh` PATH shim to force specific FFmpeg fixture layouts; everything else in the file — contract schema, `reencodes_*`, `doctor.tools`, MCP derivation, and every tool exercised through the contract including `cut.py`'s provenance fields — already ran against the real `ffmpeg` on whichever OS the test ran on, but CI skipped the *entire file* on Windows regardless. The two shim-dependent spots are now `skipIf`'d individually (visible as `skipped` in the Windows job's log, not silently absent) and CI runs the rest of the file on all three OSes. Doing this surfaced a real, previously-invisible bug: `test_contract_from_installed_copy` redirects the installer's target directory by overriding `HOME`, which Node's `os.homedir()` ignores on Windows (it reads `USERPROFILE`), so the test silently installed into the runner's real home directory instead of its temp one and then failed to find the file it expected — fixed by setting both. See README, "Development".
- **Test: `cut.py`'s copy-mode keyframe snap can genuinely change the output's duration, not just its precision label.** A non-keyframe-aligned `--start`/`--end` within `--tolerance` stays in fast stream-copy mode (`mode: "copy"`), but the underlying `-ss` seek still snaps to an earlier keyframe and pulls in extra content — `output_duration` and `requested_duration` can diverge by more than a rounding error while `keyframe_snapped` stays `true`. This was already reported in `cut.py --json` (0.10.0); a new test in `tests/test_all.py` pins a real, measured, non-trivial divergence so a regression that silently reports `duration_delta_seconds: 0.0` in this scenario would be caught. No field or behaviour changed.
- **Fail loudly: `verify_output()` is now the single success criterion for every writing tool.**
  Audit of the execution chain (natural language → script → real ffmpeg → exit status → output
  verification → report) against 17 input/ffmpeg failure scenarios and a fake ffmpeg that exits 0
  with an empty output. Every scenario already failed with a non-zero exit; the fixes below make
  the failures precise and leave nothing misleading behind.
  - `verify_output()` in `_common.py`: exists, non-empty, ffprobe reads a stream. `emit()` runs it
    before printing any success, with or without `--json`.
  - Output problems are reported as `kind: "output"` ("output verification failed: <path>: not
    written | 0 bytes | ffprobe cannot read it"), no longer as an input error; a 0-byte artifact
    is removed.
  - Failure JSON carries `exit_code` and `commands` (what was planned or run) next to
    `error.kind` / `error.message`. ffmpeg failures raised by cut, loudness, silence and sync
    carry `kind: "ffmpeg"`.
  - `fit.py --fps 0` was silently treated as "no fps requested"; it is now an error.
  - SKILL.md: what "done" means (exit 0 and a probe that matches the request), and a `Failed:`
    report shape.
  - Tests: input failures (missing, corrupt, empty, wrong stream, beyond duration, bad fps),
    ffmpeg failures (invalid LUT, unwritable directory, unknown container), output verification
    with a fake ffmpeg across nine tools, no partial files left behind.
  - Evals: `evals/agent_prompts_exec.json`, five success and five failure prompts graded for real
    execution (an ffprobe-readable output exists) and honest failure (no `Done:` and no output
    when the tool failed).
- **`fit.py --rotate`/`--flip`.** New rotate 90/180/270 (clockwise; 90/270 swap width and
  height) and horizontal/vertical flip flags -- distinct from the rotation *metadata* fit.py
  already reads to size a source correctly, which is never altered by these. Verified against
  a real red/left, blue/right test fixture: `--flip h` swaps the two halves and `--rotate 90`
  rotates the left column into the top row, both confirmed pixel-exact, not just by output
  dimensions.
- **`overlay.py --video`: video-on-video picture-in-picture.** `overlay.py` could only
  composite a still image or text onto a video; there was no way to place a second *video* as
  a layer. `--video CLIP` composites it with the same `--position`/`--scale`/`--opacity`/
  `--start`/`--end` knobs `--image` already has (`scale2ref`-style scale + `format=yuva420p` +
  `colorchannelmixer` for opacity + `overlay` with a timeline `enable`). Only the main input's
  audio is kept; the PiP layer's own audio is dropped -- mixing two audio tracks is a job for
  `audio.py`. Verified with a real composite: a blue clip lands at the exact expected
  bottom-right pixel position, the rest of the frame is unaffected.
- **`overlay.py --chromakey`: green-screen compositing.** With `--video`, `--chromakey COLOR`
  (plus `--chromakey-similarity`/`--chromakey-blend`) keys that colour transparent before
  compositing, for green-screen foreground-over-background work. Verified: a green background
  behind a white square is correctly replaced by the destination clip's colour, the white
  square is untouched.
- **`insert.py --zoom`/`--pan`: Ken Burns effect.** A slow linear zoom in/out (`--zoom-amount`
  sets the end/start factor, default 1.3) and, with `--zoom`, a pan across the image while
  zoomed, built from typed enums into a generated `zoompan` expression -- never a raw
  expression from the caller. Verified against a real image with a centred marker at a known
  position: the exact screen pixel the marker's edge should reach at the final zoom factor
  changes from background to marker colour between the first and last frame, and a panned
  clip differs (PSNR ~13) from the same zoom without pan at the same timestamp -- proving the
  frame actually changes scale/position over the clip, not just that the command ran.
- **`background.py`: generate a solid-colour or gradient clip.** New tool, no input file:
  ffmpeg's own `color`/`gradients` source filters generate an exact-size, exact-duration clip
  directly, for a title-card background or a base layer for `overlay.py` to composite onto.
  Verified: a solid-colour clip's pixel matches the requested colour; a gradient's left and
  right edges are measurably different colours in the requested direction.
- **`reverse.py`: reverse playback.** New tool wrapping ffmpeg's `reverse`/`areverse` filters
  (video always, audio unless `--no-audio`). These filters buffer the whole clip in memory, so
  this is for clips it makes sense to reverse (seconds to a couple of minutes) rather than
  something the tool limits for the caller. Verified against a real two-colour clip (first
  half red, second half blue): the reversed output starts with the original's last half and
  ends with its first half, confirmed by sampled pixel colour, not just duration/dimensions.
- **`stabilize.py`: motion stabilisation.** New tool wrapping ffmpeg's two-pass
  `vidstabdetect`/`vidstabtransform` (`--shakiness`, `--smoothing`, `--zoom` to hide the black
  edges stabilizing can introduce). The transforms file passed between the two passes lives in
  a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for the run only -- this is the first tool in the codebase to
  need an on-disk intermediate between two ffmpeg passes (existing two-pass tools, like
  `loudness.py`, pass their intermediate measurement through stdout JSON instead). Requires an
  ffmpeg built with `--enable-libvidstab`; `doctor` correctly reports `stabilize` as
  `usable: no` (not a crash) on builds that lack it, such as Homebrew's default macOS build --
  verified against this repo's own `ffmpeg_filters_8.1.2_macos.txt` fixture, where
  `vidstabdetect`/`vidstabtransform` are genuinely absent from the real `-filters` listing.
  Verified the actual stabilizing effect, not just that the command runs: a synthetic shaky
  clip's measured frame-to-frame motion (via `signalstats` on a `tblend=difference` pass) drops
  from ~7.4 to ~2.9 after stabilization.
- **`sequence.py`: numbered/globbed image sequence to video.** New tool: `--pattern` accepts
  either a printf-style numbered pattern (`frame_%04d.png`) or a glob (`*.png`, sorted
  alphabetically), with the match checked against the real filesystem before ffmpeg runs (an
  empty match or a missing first frame is refused here, not discovered from an opaque ffmpeg
  error). Verified frame order is preserved end to end with a real 5-frame red/blue/red/blue/red
  sequence, both in numbered and glob mode.

- **`fit.py --height`.** Only `--width` existed ("output width ... height follows the aspect").
  Added a symmetric `--height` that mirrors `join.py`'s existing width/height resolution: give
  one and the other follows the aspect (the source aspect, or `--aspect` if also given); give
  both for an exact frame. `--width` alone still behaves exactly as before.
- **`crop.py`: crop to an exact pixel rectangle.** `fit.py --fit crop` crops to a target *aspect
  ratio*, computing the rectangle itself; there was no way to crop to a rectangle the caller
  already knows (a face-detection box, a saved crop, a hand-picked region). New tool takes
  `--x --y --width --height` in source pixels, validated before ffmpeg runs: refuses negative
  offsets, non-positive or odd width/height (4:2:0 chroma, this codebase's even-size convention
  — refused rather than silently rounded, since a caller-specified rectangle should do exactly
  what was asked or fail loudly), and a rectangle that doesn't fit inside the source frame
  (accounting for display rotation).
- **`insert.py`: still image to a timed silent video clip.** Given one image, a duration, and
  optional target frame size / fps, produces a silent, constant-frame-rate clip of exactly that
  duration and size — for title cards, end slates, or placeholders alongside real footage in
  `join.py`. `--width`/`--height` resolve the same way `fit.py`'s do (one given -> the other
  follows the image's aspect; both given -> exact frame, scaled to fill and centre-cropped, never
  distorted). Refuses non-positive `--duration`/`--fps`.
- **`join.py`: joining two or more audio-less clips together failed.** Each clip missing an audio
  track gets a synthetic silent input (`-f lavfi -i anullsrc=...`) appended to the ffmpeg command;
  the filtergraph index for that input was computed as `n + len(extra_inputs)`, but
  `extra_inputs` is a flat argv list (six tokens per synthetic input: `-f`, `lavfi`, `-t`,
  duration, `-i`, `anullsrc=...`), not a count of inputs added so far. With exactly one no-audio
  clip the two counts happen to coincide (`n + 0`); from the second no-audio clip onward the
  computed index overshoots the real one by a multiple of 6, and ffmpeg refused the whole command
  with "Invalid file index" naming an input far past the actual count. Found joining five real,
  audio-less camera samples (a genuine multi-camera source with no audio channel is not an edge
  case in real footage). Fixed by tracking the number of synthetic inputs added directly, instead
  of inferring it from the argv list's length. No change to the single-no-audio-clip path, which
  was already correct.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-09-06 — FFmpeg 8+/Windows compatibility, per-tool doctor/contract usability, provenance and honesty fixes

- **`doctor --json`: per-tool `usable`.** `doctor` reported capability-level `available`/`missing`/`unknown`, but a caller had to cross-reference each tool's own required capabilities by hand to answer "can I run `caption.py` on this machine today" -- a plain Homebrew `ffmpeg` on macOS is `ok` overall (nothing *required by every tool* is missing) while `caption.py` specifically cannot run at all. The new `tools` field folds the same per-capability state into `{"<tool>": {"usable": "yes"|"no"|"unknown", "missing": [...], "fix": "one-line remedy", "unknown": [...]}}` per tool, following the same "unknown is not missing" rule doctor already uses. Additive; every existing `doctor` key is unchanged.
- **`contract --json`: `reencodes_video`/`reencodes_audio` per tool.** Each of the 21 tools now declares, per stream type, `"always"` / `"never"` / `"conditional"` (with a `reencode_note` for the conditional ones), read from what each script's own encode/copy args actually do. Surfaces a fact that wasn't documented anywhere: `fit`, `caption`, `overlay`, `graphics`, `color`, `join`, `multicam` and `silence` always transcode audio to AAC alongside a video filter — there is no `-c:a copy` path in this codebase for a tool that also re-encodes video, so a caller cannot assume the original audio codec survives a picture-only edit. `caption.py`'s docstring now says plainly that burn-in is the only mode (no soft-subtitle mux) and always re-encodes both streams. Additive contract field; no tool's behaviour changed.
- **SKILL.md: explicit "what this skill does and does not decide".** Added a section naming what belongs to a production agent (approval, which cut is right), another skill (thumbnail composition), or nobody in this skill (content understanding, judging a highlight's interest beyond a measured proxy) -- and an explicit rule against ever falling back to a raw `ffmpeg`/`filter_complex` invocation when a request needs something none of the 21 scripts expose. The trigger description (frontmatter) is intentionally left as-is: it stays broad on purpose (any video/audio file touch), since narrowing it risks under-triggering on requests that do belong here; what changed is what the skill does once triggered. `evals/agent_prompts_24.json` gains one refusal case (`r05-no-raw-ffmpeg`) asking directly for a raw `-filter_complex` command.
- **`check.py`: plain-language `reason` on the less obvious FAILs.** Every row already had `fix` (the command that resolves it); video codec, pixel format, HDR colour and loudness FAILs now also carry `reason` ("QuickTime and iOS commonly reject video that isn't 8-bit 4:2:0") for a caller reporting the result to someone who doesn't already know why the spec value matters. Empty on PASS rows and every other check. Additive, no existing field changed.
- **`cut.py --json`: full requested-vs-actual provenance.** `expected_duration`/`duration_error_ms`/`precision`/`reencoded` already existed (0.9.1); added `requested_start`/`requested_end` (or `requested_segments` for `--segments`), `requested_duration`, `output_duration`, `duration_delta_seconds` (seconds-unit alias of `duration_error_ms`) and `mode` (`copy`/`accurate`/`hybrid` — "hybrid" means a lossless cut silently re-encoded because the keyframe snap exceeded `--tolerance`) and `keyframe_snapped`. Additive only, no existing field changed. Intended for a downstream repo (an editing skill, an agent) that wants this in its own provenance/audit trail without re-deriving it from `reencoded`+`precision`.
- **`render.py`'s check stage now sets the exit code.** A `project.json` with a `"check"` stage always returned 0, even when the delivery-spec check failed or `check.py` itself couldn't run — `render.py` was the one tool in the skill that could report a broken deliverable as a success. It now exits 1 in both cases, matching `check.py`'s own exit code exactly; `--json`'s `check` field still carries the full row-by-row result either way, and the output file is still written (this changes the exit code, not what gets rendered).
- **Test: docstring examples can't drift from the parser.** `scenes.py`'s docstring once claimed a ranking option (motion) that was never implemented; that was prose, not an example, so nothing caught it. A new `test_contract.py` test at least closes the more common version of this gap: every `--flag` used in a script's own `Examples:` lines must exist in that script's real argparse parser, checked via the contract's `input_schema`. Verified to catch a deliberately introduced typo before writing this entry. Does not (and cannot) catch a false claim made only in prose.
- **SKILL.md: explicit language-matching instruction.** The agent has always been graded on replying in the user's language (see the 24-prompt eval), but SKILL.md never actually said to — it worked by the model's own default, not by instruction. The Report format section now says explicitly: reply in whatever language the request was written in (Japanese, English, Chinese, or any other), keep only the field labels (`Done:`, `Steps:`, ...) in English, and follow a language switch mid-conversation. No code change; this only affects the model-facing instructions.
- **`multicam.py` low-confidence warning.** `sync.py` warns on stderr when its cross-correlation confidence is below 0.1 ("check that both files contain the same audio event"); `multicam.py` used the same measurement per camera but never warned, even though it applies the offset to a rendered cut rather than just reporting it. It now warns per camera below the same threshold. SKILL.md's existing "check `confidence` before trusting a sync" guidance now names `multicam.py`'s per-camera confidence explicitly.
- **`sync.py`/`multicam.py` documentation: audio sync is not lip sync.** Both align audio tracks to each other by cross-correlation; neither has ever done any face or mouth detection, and a high `confidence` only means the audio matched well, not that the final picture looks in sync. This was previously undocumented; `sync.py`'s docstring, `multicam.py`'s docstring and SKILL.md now say so explicitly. No behaviour change.
- **`export.py --preset copy`.** Every existing preset re-encodes (even `prores`/`h265`, which
  keep the source resolution). A caller with nothing to change — the deliverable already matches
  the source, no platform target — had no way to get a real, delivered file out of `export.py`
  without paying for and risking a needless re-encode. `copy` is a genuine stream copy (`-c:v
  copy -c:a copy`, no `-an` unless the source truly has no audio track): same codecs, same
  container (keeps the source's own extension unless `-o` names one), same colour tags — it
  skips the CFR-conforming (`-r`/`-fps_mode cfr`) and BT.709-retagging steps every re-encoding
  preset applies, since neither is meaningful (or safe) without decoding the picture, and it
  never issues the HDR "outputs SDR BT.709 tags" warning other presets do, because it doesn't
  touch colour at all. `-movflags +faststart` still applies when the resolved output is `.mp4`
  (a real optimisation a copy can do for free). Verified codec/resolution/frame-count/HDR-tags
  stay byte-for-byte the source's, not just nominally unchanged (frame count via `ffprobe
  -count_frames`, which a re-encode could silently drop or duplicate).

- **`scenes.py --rank-by`.** `--highlights` ranked candidate scenes by audio energy only, and the docstring falsely claimed motion was also used (it never was — dead documentation). `--rank-by {audio,duration}` (default audio, unchanged) makes the criterion explicit and adds a real second option (longest scene first); the result JSON now reports `highlights_rank_by`.
- **`fit.py --crop-x` / `--crop-y`.** `--fit crop` always cropped from the centre, so reframing a wide shot to 9:16 could cut off a subject held to one side (a product, a person off-centre). `--crop-x`/`--crop-y` (0=left/top, 0.5=centre default, 1=right/bottom) pick which edge to keep instead; range-checked before ffmpeg runs. No change to the default (centre) behaviour.
- **Filter file paths on Windows.** `subtitles=`, `ass=`, `lut3d=file=`, `fontfile=` and `fontsdir=` values are parsed twice by ffmpeg (graph, then filter options), so a drive letter needs two levels of colon escaping (`D\\\\:/x.srt`). 0.9.1 escaped once and every caption / LUT job on Windows failed with `Unable to parse "original_size" option value` or `Error parsing a filter description`. `escape_filter_path` now escapes for both passes; `;` is escaped too. Reproduced and tested on Linux with a directory literally named `D:` plus spaces and non-ASCII in the path.
- **`overlay.py --image` length on FFmpeg 7+.** `-shortest` alone left up to 2 s of the looped still after the video ended (8.1 / 9.0); the command now also passes `-t <video duration>`.
- **`--help` on a legacy Windows console.** stdout / stderr are reconfigured to UTF-8 (with replacement) by `_common`, so non-ASCII help text (Japanese example, arrows) no longer raises `UnicodeEncodeError`; the test harness decodes script output as UTF-8.
- **macOS CI** installs `ffmpeg-full`: Homebrew's `ffmpeg` formula no longer links libass / freetype / harfbuzz / zimg, so it has no `subtitles`, `ass`, `drawtext` or `zscale` filter. README, the installer hint and `_common`'s own `require_tool` error message (`INSTALL_HINTS`) all say so now.
- Tests: the contract-test fixture used `-vsync vfr`, an option FFmpeg 9 removed (`-fps_mode vfr` since 5.1); filter paths with a drive colon, spaces and Unicode through caption (SRT, ASS, fonts dir), color (LUT full and blended) and overlay (`fontfile`), with PSNR proving the caption and LUT changed the picture; overlay still bounded by the video length; `--help` under a cp1252 console.
- **`provides`**: `contract --json` gains a top-level `provides` field listing all 21 tools by a cross-repository Capability id (`ffmpeg-skill.<tool>`) for `kajisho5/AI-video-production-OS`'s `CapabilityContract.provides` — see `docs/contract.md`.

## 0.9.2 — typed primary colour correction

- **color.py**: `--correct` (exposure / contrast / saturation / white balance), a fourth colour mode
  alongside `--to-sdr` / `--lut` / `--retag` / `--strip-dovi`. Each flag is one option of one real,
  always-available libavfilter filter — `--exposure` (`exposure` filter, -3..3 stops), `--contrast` /
  `--saturation` (`eq` filter, 0..2, 1=unchanged), `--temperature` (`colortemperature`, 2000..12000 K,
  6500=unchanged) and `--tint` (green -1 .. +1 magenta, mapped to `colorbalance`'s three midtone
  channels: `gm=-tint`, `rm=bm=tint/2`) — range-checked against this script's own safe subset of what
  each filter documents (`ffmpeg -h filter=<name>`) before ffmpeg runs; no filter string, `filter_complex`
  or raw argv is ever accepted from the caller. The four stages (exposure → white balance → contrast →
  saturation) are always chained in that fixed order, each one always present at its filter's own
  documented no-op default, so the pipeline is one stable four-filter chain regardless of which flags
  were given. `--json`'s `measurements` field carries `analyze_levels()` (signalstats luma/saturation)
  for the input and the output side by side — an OBSERVED technical measurement, never a "looks better"
  judgement.
- Contract: `color`'s optional capabilities gain `filter:exposure` / `filter:eq` / `filter:colorbalance` /
  `filter:colortemperature` (declared `when: "--correct"`); `X264` now also lists `--correct` among its
  callers. No change to any existing flag, contract field, MCP schema or tool semantics.
- Tests: 4 real-media tests in `tests/test_all.py` (defaults are near-identity, positive exposure raises
  measured luma, `--saturation 0` desaturates, temperature/tint run and preserve geometry, five
  out-of-range parameters are each refused with no partial output).

## 0.9.1 — FFmpeg 8 capability detection; audio extraction, audio join, sample-accurate trims, typed dynamics

- **doctor / contract on FFmpeg 8.** `ffmpeg -filters` prints two flag characters on FFmpeg 8 (`T. acompressor A->A`) where 6 and 7 print three (`..C`); 0.9.0 anchored on three and reported every `filter:*` capability missing on FFmpeg 8 (macOS / Windows CI of consumers). Rows are now recognised by their `A->A` io-spec token, encoders by the `------` separator, so the flag width no longer matters. A listing that cannot be read yields a third state, `unknown`, distinct from `missing` (an installed filter is never reported absent) and from `available` (a failed detection is never a pass); `detection` and `errors` say which listing failed and why; exit 2 for "required but unknown". Existing keys unchanged. Fixtures for the 6.1 capture and the 7 / 8 layouts in `tests/fixtures/`, tests through a fake ffmpeg.
- **audio.py**: an audio output extension on a video input drops the picture (`audio.py talk.mp4 -o talk.wav` extracts; `--voice -o talk.m4a` cleans on the way) instead of failing inside the WAV muxer; `--audio-stream N` picks a track (`probe` lists `audio_streams`). Typed dynamics: `--compress` (`--comp-threshold/-ratio/-attack/-release/-makeup/-knee`), `--limit` (`--limit-ceiling/-attack/-release`), `--gate` (`--gate-threshold/-ratio/-attack/-release/-range/-knee`), each flag one documented option of acompressor / alimiter / agate, range-checked before ffmpeg runs, dB converted to the linear value the filter takes; no filter string is accepted from the caller.
- **join.py**: audio-only inputs (WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A, ...) are joined as audio at one sample rate (first clip's, `--sample-rate`) and channel layout (widest, `--channels`), with `acrossfade` or a butt join; the output must have an audio extension; audio and video inputs cannot be mixed. Contract: `join` is `audio_only: true`, `video_required: false`.
- **cut.py**: the codec follows the output extension on re-encode (`-o x.wav` is PCM; a `.wav` never receives AAC packets, which 0.9.0 wrote on `--accurate` and on the keyframe fallback for audio inputs); an audio extension on a video input extracts the audio; audio stream copies seek on the output side so `-c copy` lands on the packet, not the previous video keyframe; `--accurate` on audio trims at the sample (`atrim`). The JSON reports `precision` (`packet` / `sample` / `codec_frame` / `frame`), `duration_error_ms` and `reencoded`. Measured: WAV copy within 2 ms, `--accurate` WAV / FLAC / AAC-to-WAV exact to the sample at 44.1 and 48 kHz, AAC output +21 ms (encoder priming, reported as `codec_frame`).
- `probe` adds `audio_streams` (index, codec, channels, layout, sample rate, language, title).
- Tests: 5 doctor detection tests (FFmpeg 6 / 7 / 8 layouts, garbage, failure), 4 audio tests (extraction and stream selection, audio join, measured precision, typed dynamics); evals `evals/agent_prompts_audio2.json`.

## 0.9.0 — machine-readable execution contract

`ffmpeg-skill contract --json` (`python3 scripts/_contract.py --json`) describes the skill for agent frameworks: `contract_version` 1.0 separate from the skill version; one ToolSpec per public script (`ffmpeg-skill/<name>`) with an input schema generated from its argparse parser, an output schema, role (analysis / analysis_and_execution / execution / verification), required and conditional ffmpeg capabilities, dry-run support, `mutates_input: false`, the verification tools to run afterwards, and whether a visual check is required. `ffmpeg-skill doctor` reports which capabilities the machine has. `docs/contract.md` explains the fields and how a planner consumes them.

- `--json` results now carry `"status": "completed"`; failures under `--json` also print `{"status": "failed", "error": {"kind", "message"}}` on stdout (stderr message and exit codes unchanged).
- `--dry-run` no longer writes the generated SRT (`caption.py --text`) or the HTML (`report.py`).
- MCP server lists `batch` (the one script it was missing); `tools/list` now equals the contract's tool list, and a test keeps it that way.
- MCP `tools/list` is derived from the contract: no tool table or hand-written `inputSchema` in `mcp/server.py` any more. Names, order, `inputSchema` (translated from `ToolSpec.input_schema`: types, enums, defaults, descriptions, required fields, mutually exclusive groups, the non-canonical `argv` branch) and the structured-argument mapping all come from `scripts/_contract.py`. Tests: schema equality for all 21 tools, byte-identical `tools/list`, drift (add / remove / edit a script), and JSON-RPC round trips of probe, cut, silence, loudness, export and render built from the derived schema.
- Installer copies `package.json` so an installed skill knows its version, and answers `contract` / `doctor`.
- `tests/test_contract.py` (unit + integration, including a fake-ffmpeg dry-run guard and the real-device corpus when present), `evals/contract/`, `npm run release-check` extended.
- No new editing features; no script changed its media behaviour.

## 0.8.5 — audio-only inputs, spelled out

- SKILL.md: "Audio-only files" section. WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A/AAC, OGG and Opus go through `probe`, `cut`, `silence`, `loudness`, `audio`, `sync` and `check --platform podcast` unchanged; the output extension picks the codec; `Look: not needed`; picture scripts refuse with "input has no video stream". Six audio-only request→script rows.
- Evals: six audio-only agent prompts (`evals/agent_prompts_audio.json`), grader checks that audio-only runs use no picture script and mark the visual check not needed, routing tasks 25–29, two audio-only trigger cases. First run: 6/6 on every criterion.
- Test for WAV/M4A/MP3 through the audio scripts (56 tests).
- GitHub Sponsors: `.github/FUNDING.yml` and a Support section in the README.

## 0.8.4 — three repeats, independent grading

The 24-prompt evaluation was run three times (72 agent runs, `evals/results/iteration-2-4.json`) and every run was graded by a separate model (`evals/results/iteration-2-4-independent-grades.json`): routing 72/72, honest 72/72, user's language 72/72, report format 71/72, visual check whenever the picture changed 24/24, mean quality 4.9 / 5. Script choices were identical across repeats; only defaults (crop vs pad, silence margin) varied.

- `overlay.py --fade` without `--start`/`--end` now fades in at 0 and out at the end of the video (it was silently ignored; found by an agent during the runs).
- `--dry-run` no longer prints "wrote <file>" for a file that was not written (central fix in `_common.info`).

## 0.8.3 — internals and triggering

- `_common.py`: the shared flag state is an explicit `Context` object (`STATE.dry_run` etc., dict-style access kept), `run()` is split into recording, dry-run, captured and progress paths with one failure handler. Behaviour unchanged: 54/54 tests and the sync benchmark give identical numbers before and after.
- `sync.py`: the 35 % minimum-overlap and the square-root overlap weight are named constants with the benchmark rationale (what 0.2 / 0.5 and exponents 0.25 / 1.0 did) written next to them.
- Trigger tests (`evals/trigger/`): 10 should-trigger and 10 should-not requests judged by an independent model against a catalog with four decoy skills. 20/20 on this description.

## 0.8.2 — second agent-run evaluation

24 prompts (12 English edits, 8 Japanese edits, 4 that must be declined) run by independent agents against the 0.8.1 skill (`evals/agent_prompts_24.json`, `evals/grade_runs_24.py`, `evals/results/iteration-2.json`). Routing 24/24, honest refusals 4/4, Japanese reports 9/9, visual check whenever the picture changed 8/8, mean 6.5 commands per job.

- `caption.py --text` now writes the generated SRT beside the output file, not beside the source.
- `probe.py` accepts the common flags (`--json`, `--field` etc.) like every other script.
- `audio.py`: `--music-fade-out` fades only the bed; `--fade-out` fades the whole mix (previously both were applied at once). `render.py` project audio gained `music_fade_out`.
- SKILL.md: how to find a CJK font before burning Japanese captions.
- Tests for all of the above; render test no longer depends on a clean output directory.

## 0.8.1 — skill craft

The skill file itself, measured. Six realistic prompts were run by independent agents with the old and the restructured SKILL.md (`evals/agent_prompts.json`, `evals/grade_runs.py`, results in `evals/results/`).

- SKILL.md rewritten for the agent, not as a catalogue: a description that says when to trigger; body 402 → 169 lines with workflow, what to ask vs assume, request→script map, report format and "looks right but is wrong" pitfalls; per-script CLI reference moved to `references/scripts.md`, real-device notes to `references/devices.md` (both installed and packaged).
- Results: routing 100 % for both versions; mean commands per job 9.0 → 7.7 (the Reels job went from 16 commands with a forced redo to a single `render.py` pass); report format followed 4/6 → 6/6.
- Found and fixed from the transcripts: `check.py` warned on untagged 8-bit H.264 and agents added a pointless retag (now PASS); `look.py --at` stamped 00:00:00.000 on every frame (now the requested time); the "fix FAILs" instruction made an agent boost -44 LUFS park ambience by 30 dB (check step reworded, pitfall added).

## 0.8.0 — validation release

Measured instead of assumed. New `tests/corpus.py` pulls public real-device videos (GoPro HERO 4K 10-bit, DJI 4K60 no-audio, two iPhones incl. Dolby Vision 4K60, two Android screen recordings incl. 18 fps VFR and 120 fps, an HDR10 PQ test pattern, a 24p clip, and Blender's Tears of Steel) and runs `verify.py` over them; `tests/bench_*.py` score algorithms against known ground truth.

- `sync.py`: normalised cross-correlation over the overlap (prefix-sum energies) with a runner-up-aware confidence. Lags with under 35 % overlap are ignored and scores carry a sqrt(overlap) weight so partial coincidental matches cannot beat the true alignment. Benchmark on real dialogue/music (±30 s offsets, gain, noise, EQ): 120 s windows 40/40 within 10 ms (max 1.1 ms); 60 s stress windows went from 86 % to 95 %, with 4 of the 5 remaining misses flagged by confidence < 0.3.
- `scenes.py`: cuts are now one-frame spikes (score above threshold and > 3× the neighbouring median), not any frame over a threshold; motion, flashes and pans stop registering. `--ratio` added. Benchmark on 53 hard cuts between single-take corpus clips: precision 0.95, recall 1.00 (F1 0.97) at the default threshold 8; 0.98 / 0.94 at 12.
- `loudness.py`: silent input is reported (`"silent": true`) instead of crashing; normalisation refuses with a clear message.
- `verify.py`: tone-maps the HDR-preserved cut instead of the whole file (a 10-minute 4K HDR source timed out).
- Corpus results: 90/92 verify steps pass on first run; both failures fixed above. Silence benchmark: 0 missed gaps, ≤1 ms leftover silence over 20 cases.
- SKILL.md: sync guidance now cites the benchmark and the 4× window rule.

## 0.7.0

- `mcp/server.py` (new): the whole toolkit as an MCP server over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0, standard library only). Every script is a tool; named args or raw argv; results as structured JSON. Installed alongside scripts by `npx ffmpeg-skill`.
- `batch.py` (new): apply a step recipe or a render project to every file in a folder, content-hash cache so re-runs only touch changed files, `--watch` polling.
- `caption.py --transcribe`: optional local speech-to-text bridge (whisper.cpp `whisper-cli`, faster-whisper, or openai-whisper if present). Never required; a clear install hint otherwise.
- Tests: 49 end-to-end cases.

## 0.6.0

- `graphics.py` (new): motion-graphics templates with no image assets — lower-third (slide in/out), title card, chapter chip, progress bar, countdown, corner bug — coloured from brand.json.
- `brand.json` support: fonts, colours, logo (position/scale/opacity), safe margin, caption defaults. `caption.py --brand`, `overlay.py --brand --logo`, `graphics.py --brand`, and a `"brand"` key in `render.py` projects (plus a `graphics` stage and `{"logo": true}` overlays).
- `report.py` (new): single-file HTML delivery report with before/after contact sheets, media facts, loudness, compliance table and the commands run.
- Tests: 46 end-to-end cases.

## 0.5.0

- `render.py` (new): declarative edits from one `project.json` (clips → join → silence → fit → captions → overlays → audio → loudness → export → check). `--init` writes a starter, `--dry-run` prints every command, `--stop-after` for iterating.
- `scenes.py` (new): scene changes (scdet) and audio peaks, highlight proposals sized to a target duration, `--edl` for `cut.py --segments`, per-scene contact sheet.
- `check.py` (new): pre-delivery compliance for youtube / shorts / reels / tiktok / x / linkedin / broadcast / podcast / custom: duration, aspect, resolution, fps, VFR, codec, pixel format, colour/HDR, file size, loudness, true peak, with the fix command per failure.
- `evals/`: 24 natural-language routing tasks with expected scripts, plus a transcript scorer.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: 3-OS matrix, manual trigger only until the Actions quota resets.
- `join.py`: `--width` alone keeps the first clip's aspect; `--fast` no longer breaks `export.py` presets.

## 0.4.1

Fixes found by running `verify.py` on a real iPhone clip (Dolby Vision 8.4 / HLG, 10-bit HEVC, 60 fps VFR, portrait rotation, extra metadata tracks):

- HDR sources now stay HDR through every re-encode (`cut`, `fit`, `caption`, `overlay`, `silence`, `join`, `multicam`, `sync`): HEVC Main10 with the source's HLG/PQ tags instead of an 8-bit H.264 file mislabelled BT.709. Use `color.py --to-sdr` when you want SDR.
- Audio mapping uses the first audio stream only (`0:a:0?`); iPhone `.mov` files carry timecode/metadata tracks that broke `-map 0:a?`.
- `probe.py --analyze` normalises 10-/12-bit levels to an 8-bit scale before the Log heuristic.
- `look.py` tone-maps HDR frames for display so the agent judges representative colours.
- `verify.py` runs `color --to-sdr` on the original file and adds an "hdr preserved" check on the accurate cut.

## 0.4.0

- `verify.py` (new): real-footage verification kit — runs the toolchain over the user's own files and reports PASS/FAIL per step, Markdown and JSON.
- `multicam.py` (new): align N cameras/recorders by audio (drift correction optional), switch between them from a time list or automatically, pick the audio source.
- `probe.py`: Dolby Vision detection (`dolby_vision`, `hdr_format`), `--analyze` samples picture levels and flags Log-looking footage.
- `color.py`: `--strip-dovi` removes the Dolby Vision RPU losslessly; HLG and DV 8.4 sources verified through `--to-sdr`.
- `caption.py`: karaoke word timing now follows speech energy in the audio (`--karaoke-timing energy|even`).
- `--progress` (percent / ETA) and `--fast` (preview preset) on every script.
- Tests: 38 end-to-end cases.

## 0.3.0

- `look.py` (new): contact sheet with timecodes, single-frame extraction, side-by-side before/after PNGs — the agent can inspect its own output.
- `silence.py` (new): silence detection and frame-accurate removal with margins, `--list` and `--edl` cut-list export compatible with `cut.py --segments`.
- `join.py` (new): xfade/acrossfade transitions between clips with automatic normalisation of size, fps, pixel format and audio layout (silent track synthesised when missing).
- `--dry-run` and `--json` on every script: print the ffmpeg commands without running, or emit a structured result (output, probe, commands).
- SKILL.md workflow now includes plan (`--dry-run`) and visual verification (`look.py`) steps.

## 0.2.0

- `color.py` (new): HDR10/HLG → SDR BT.709 tone mapping (zscale + tonemap), 3D `.cube` LUTs with strength blending, metadata-only colour retagging.
- `audio.py` (new): voice clean-up chain, FFT denoise, music bed with sidechain ducking, fades, 5.1 → stereo downmix, mono/stereo layout, track replacement.
- `sync.py`: coarse-to-fine search (20 ms FFT → 1 ms direct) and `--fix-drift` clock-drift measurement and correction by resampling; roughly 5x faster on the default window.
- `caption.py`: `--animate fade|pop|slide` and `--karaoke` word-by-word highlight, generated as a styled ASS sized to the video; SRT input can be animated too.
- `fit.py`: `--smooth blend|interpolate` for slow motion.
- VFR sources are conformed to constant frame rate automatically by every re-encoding script; `cut.py` switches to accurate mode on VFR.
- `probe.py`: `hdr`, `hdr_format`, `bit_depth` fields.
- `export.py`: warns when an HDR source is exported without tone mapping.
- Tests now cover VFR, rotated, 5.1, 10-bit HDR10 HEVC and drifting sources.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: probe, cut, caption, fit, sync, loudness, overlay, export; npx installer; demo and tests.
